'''Czech philosophy''', has often eschewed "pure" speculative philosophy,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://ii.fmph.uniba.sk/~filit/fvf/filozofia_ceska.html|title=Fvf:Filozofia česká|website=ii.fmph.uniba.sk|accessdate=9 April 2018}}</ref> emerging rather in the course of intellectual debates in the fields of education (e.g. [[Jan Amos Komenský]]), art (e.g. [[Karel Teige]]), literature (e.g. [[Milan Kundera]]), and especially politics (e.g. [[Tomáš Masaryk|Tomáš Garrigue Masaryk]], [[Karel Kosík]], [[Ivan Sviták]], [[Václav Havel]]). A source drawing from literature, however, distinguished the Czech national philosophy from the speculative tradition of German thought, citing that it emerged from folk wisdom and peasant reasoning.<ref>{{Cite book|title=History of the Literary Cultures of East-Central Europe: Junctures and disjunctures in the 19th and 20th centuries.

Masaryk is credited for introducing the [[Epistemology|epistemological]] problem into the modern Czech philosophy, which in turn influenced the discourse on symbol and symbolization.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Structure of the Literary Process: Studies Dedicated to the Memory of Felix Vodic?ka|last=Steiner|first=Peter|last2=Miroslav ?ervenka|last3=Vroon|first3=Ronald|date=1982|publisher=John Benjamins Publishing|isbn=902721512X|location=Amsterdam|pages=557}}</ref> Czech philosophers have also played a central role in the development of [[phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenology]], whose German-speaking founder [[Edmund Husserl]] was born in the [[Czech lands]]. Czechs [[Jan Patočka]] and [[Václav Bělohradský]] would later make important contributions to phenomenological thought.

Positivism became an important and dominant trend of modern Czech philosophy, eclipsing [[Herbartianism|herbatianism]] , in what is explained as a collective "post-revolutionary" thinking characterized by an attempt to open a window to Europe in order to eliminate traces of philosophical provincialism.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Czech Philosophy in the XXth Century|last=Nový|first=Lubomír|last2=Gabriel|first2=Jiří|last3=Hroch|first3=Jaroslav|date=1994|publisher=Paideia Press & CRVP|isbn=1565180283|location=Washington, D.C.|pages=31}}</ref>
