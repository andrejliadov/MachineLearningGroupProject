The '''Kraft Circle''' was a student society of [[Philosophy|philosophers]] at the Institut für Österreichische Geschichtsforschung of the [[University of Vienna]] devoted to "considering philosophical problems in a nonmetaphysical manner and with special reference to the findings of the sciences".<ref>Paul Feyerabend, “Herbert Feigl: A Biographical Sketch”, in P. K. Feyerabend and Grover Maxwell (eds.), ''Mind, Matter, and Method: Essays in Philosophy and Science in Honor of Herbert Feigl'' (Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1966), 1–2, quoted in Preston 2009.</ref> Its chairman and leading professor was [[Viktor Kraft]], a former associate of the [[Vienna Circle]], to which the Kraft Circle is sometimes viewed as a post-[[Second World War]] extension. The Circle was a part of the Austrian College Society founded in 1945 by [[Austria]]n resistance fighters.<ref>An early leader was Otto Molden, brother of Fritz Molden of publishing house fame (Feyerabend 1988, 274).</ref> 

The club was founded in 1949 by science and engineering students interested in the philosophical foundations of their disciplines. In the first year [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] gave a talk.<ref>He "took a long time to make up his mind and then appeared over an hour later [and] gave a spirited performance and seemed to prefer our disrespectful attitude to the fawning admiration he encountered elsewhere" (Feyerabend 1988, 274).</ref> The members were mainly students, but there were occasional faculty attendees and even "foreign dignitaries" made appearances.<ref>Feyerabend 1988, 274, lists the Hungarian Béla Juhos, the Austrians Erich Heintel and Walter Hollitscher, the Finn [[Georg Henrik von Wright]] and the Englishwoman [[G. E. M. Anscombe]].</ref> Meetings of the circle took place during the academic year, while international meetings of the Austrian College Society took place during the summer at [[Alpbach]]. The circle disbanded in 1952/53. Feyerabend's paper "An Attempt at a Realistic Interpretation of Experience" (''Proceedings of the Aristotelian Society'' [1958]) is "a condensed version of the discussions in the Kraft Circle".<ref>Preston 2009.</ref>
