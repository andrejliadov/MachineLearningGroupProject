'''''Arya: A Philosophical Review''''' was a 64-page monthly [[periodical]] written by [[Sri Aurobindo]] and published in [[India]] between 1914 and 1921. The majority of the material which initially appeared in the ''Arya'' was later edited and published in book-form as ''The Life Divine'', ''The Synthesis of Yoga'', ''The Secret of the Veda'', ''The Foundations of Indian Culture'' and ''The Ideal of Human Unity'' as well as a number of translations of [[Vedas|Vedic literature]].

==Conception==
The ''Arya'' was conceived as a joint venture of Sri Aurobindo and Paul Richard, a French national residing at [[Pondicherry (city)|Pondicherry]], in the spring of 1914. Sri Aurobindo remarked on more than one occasion that, though he was not adverse to the idea, it was Richard who initially proposed the project of publishing a journal. In a letter to Dilip Kumar Roy dated 4 September 1934, he wrote:

{{quote|I knew precious little about philosophy before I did the Yoga and came to Pondicherry — I was a poet and a politician, not a philosopher! How I managed to do it? First, because Richard proposed to me to co-operate in a philosophical review — and as my theory was that a Yogi ought to be able to turn his hand to anything, I could not very well refuse....<ref name="harvp|Roy|1952|p=49">{{harvp|Roy|1952|p=49}}</ref>}}

It was clear to Sri Aurobindo that the proposed journal would represent a medium through which he could give voice to his still-emerging philosophy – both in India and abroad. In a letter to Motilal Roy from June 1914, he wrote:

{{quote|[This] attempt takes the form of a new philosophical review with Richard and myself as Editors — the ''Arya'', which is to be brought out in French and English, two separate editions, — one for France, one for India, England and America. In this Review my new theory of the Veda will appear as also translation and explanation of the [[Upanishads]], a series of essays giving my system of [[Yoga]] and a book of [[Vedanta|Vedantic philosophy]] (not [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s but Vedic Vedanta) giving the Upanishadic foundations of my theory of the ideal life towards which humanity must move. You will see so far as my share is concerned, it will be the intellectual side of my work for the world.<ref name="documents">''Documents in the Life of Sri Aurobindo''.

==Title==
Although it is unknown who was responsible for the choice of ''Arya'' as the title of the journal, Sri Aurobindo explained what he understood the term to represent. In the second issue (September, 1914), he composed an article entitled ''Arya: Its Significance'' in which he set forth the meaning of the term as he intended it. He wrote:

{{quote|Intrinsically, in its most fundamental sense, ''[[arya]]'' means an effort or an uprising and overcoming. The Aryan is he who strives and overcomes all outside him and within him that stands opposed to the human advance. Self-conquest is the first law of his nature. He overcomes earth and the body and does not consent like ordinary men to their dullness, inertia, dead routine and [[Tamas (philosophy)|tamasic]] limitations. He overcomes life and its energies and refuses to be dominated by their hungers and cravings or enslaved by their [[rajas]]ic passions. He overcomes the mind and its habits, he does not live in a shell of ignorance, inherited prejudices, customary ideas, pleasant opinions, but knows how to seek and choose, to be large and flexible in intelligence even as he is firm and strong in his will. For in everything he seeks truth, in everything right, in everything height and freedom.<ref>{{harvp|Aurobindo|1989|pp=411–414}}</ref>}}

==Program and organization==
The ''Arya'' was advertised as "a review of pure philosophy"<ref name="Our_Programme">From an English translation of the original French prospectus with the title ''Our Programme''; in ''Documents in the Life of Sri Aurobindo''. Retrieved from: [http://www.sriaurobindoashram.org/ Sri Aurobindo Ashram].</ref> with a twofold object:

# A systematic study of the highest problems of existence.
# The formation of a synthesis of knowledge, harmonizing the diverse religious traditions of humanity, occidental as well as oriental.<ref name="Our_Programme"/>

The method of the review was described as one of "realism, at once rational and transcendental; a realism consisting in the unification of intellectual and scientific discipline with those of intuitive experimentation."<ref name="Our_Programme"/>

The material appearing in the ''Arya'' was organized under four main headings:

# Synthetic studies in speculative philosophy.
# Translations and commentaries of ancient texts.
# Studies in comparative Religion.
# Practical methods of inner culture and self-development.<ref name="Our_Programme"/>

==Early difficulties==
Although Sri Aurobindo and Richard had planned to share the work of writing and editing the material which was to appear in the journal, Richard was ordered by the French Government to leave Pondicherry and return to France in the middle of 1915.<ref name="documents"/> As a result, the French edition of the journal (''Revue de Grande Synthèse'') was discontinued after only seven issues.<ref>{{harvp|Iyengar|1945|p=234}}; see also {{harvp|Heehs|2008|p=261}}.</ref> Subscriptions for ''Arya'' had been sold prior to publication, and Sri Aurobindo was left with the task of completing the outstanding issues. As he remarked in 1934:

{{quote|[...] And then he [Richard] had to go to the war and left me in the lurch with 64 pages a month of philosophy all to write by my lonely self...<ref name="harvp|Roy|1952|p=49"/>}}

Excepting the three contributions made by Richard to the journal (''The Wherefore of the Worlds'', ''The Eternal Wisdom'' and the short ''Sons of Heaven''; see below), the bulk of the remainder was composed by Sri Aurobindo himself.

==Discontinuation==
In 1921, after six and a half years of uninterrupted publication, Sri Aurobindo discontinued the ''Arya''. In a private discussion in 1926, he gave his reasons for this decision:

{{quote|I stopped the ''Arya'' when I found that I had to put myself out to much — so to say, externalized too much. The second reason was that I required to be drawn within myself in order to develop certain experiences, so that the energy might be used for inward work.<ref>{{harvp|Purani|1970}}</ref>}}

==Subsequent reprinting and distribution==
Although Sri Aurobindo had discontinued its publication, there was an increasing demand for back issues of the ''Arya'' after 1921. This led him to have the ''Arya'' reprinted in seven volumes, preserving the order in which the articles had originally appeared. The contents of these seven volumes are as follows:<ref>These titles, unless otherwise noted, were written by Sri Aurobindo.</ref>
