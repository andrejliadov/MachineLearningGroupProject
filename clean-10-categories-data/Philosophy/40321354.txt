'''Thierry Henri Philippe Baudet''' (born 28 January 1983) is a Dutch politician and author. He is the founder and former leader of [[Forum for Democracy]], and has been a member of the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] since 2017. He also served as the party's [[parliamentary leader]] until he resigned on 23 November 2020.<ref>{{cite web |title=Naar aanleiding van de ontwikkelingen in de afgelopen dagen geeft partijleider  @thierrybaudet  het volgende statement Downwards arrow #GeenTrialByMedia |url=https://twitter.com/fvdemocratie/status/1330922769568198660 |website=Twitter |publisher=Twitter |access-date=23 November 2020}}</ref>

==Early life==
Baudet was born in [[Heemstede]] into a family of partial [[Wallonia|Walloon]] ancestry. His forefather Pierre Joseph Baudet immigrated to the [[Batavian Republic]] in 1795 when his home in [[Hainaut Province|Hainaut]] was annexed by the [[French First Republic|French Republic]], fleeing from conscription into the French Army. Baudet's great-great-grandmother Ernestine van Heemskerck was born in the [[Dutch East Indies]] and was of partly [[Indonesians|Indonesian]] parentage.<ref name=genealogy>{{Cite news|url=https://ontdekjouwverhaal.nl/nieuws/52782-2/ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180713233213/https://ontdekjouwverhaal.nl/nieuws/52782-2/ |archive-date=2018-07-13 |author=Peter Fasol |title=De genealogie van Thierry Baudet |work=Nederlandse Genealogische Vereniging |access-date=2018-07-13|language=nl-NL}}</ref>

Baudet learned Latin and Greek in high school.<ref name=nation>{{cite web|url=https://www.thenation.com/article/archive/is-dutch-bad-boy-thierry-baudet-the-new-face-of-the-european-alt-right/|title=Baudet the New Face of the European Alt-Right?|first=Sebastiaan|last=Faber|date= 5 April 2018|website=thenation.com}}</ref> His first degree, from the [[University of Amsterdam]], was in history, and from 2007 to 2012 he was a lecturer at [[Leiden University]], where in 2012 he graduated as a [[Doctor of Philosophy]] with a thesis on national identity, European identity, and [[multiculturalism]].<ref name="parlement.com">{{Cite web|url=https://www.parlement.com/id/vjuuhtscjwpn/t_h_ph_thierry_baudet|title=Dr. T.H.Ph.

An English translation was also published, called ''The Significance of Borders''.<ref name=nation/>

==Career==
[[File:Thierry Baudet (2018).jpg|thumb|upright|Thierry Baudet in 2018]]
Baudet was a post-doctoral fellow at [[Tilburg University]] in 2013.<ref name="parlement.com"/> He also wrote a newspaper column in ''[[NRC Handelsblad]]'' from 2011 to 2012.<ref name="parlement.com" />

In late 2016, he founded the [[Forum for Democracy]] (FvD, {{lang-nl|Forum voor Democratie}}), which became a political party, and was elected along with [[Theo Hiddema]] to the [[House of Representatives (Netherlands)|House of Representatives]] in the [[2017 Dutch general election|2017 general election]].{{cn|date=November 2020}}

Baudet had his personal piano installed in his parliamentary office in [[the Hague]]. In 2018, he said that his current girlfriend was an Iranian refugee.<ref name=nation />

==Political views==
Baudet is a [[National conservatism|national conservative]] and [[Euroscepticism|Eurosceptic]], advocating for both Netherlands' exit from the European Union and its eventual dissolution. He is against unskilled [[immigration]] into the Netherlands. In a speech he spoke about immigration causing a [[homeopathy|homeopathic]] [[dilution (equation)|dilution]]<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.nporadio1.nl/dit-is-de-dag/onderwerpen/400417-baudet-snapt-ophef-om-homeopatische-verdunning-niet|title=Baudet snapt ophef om 'homeopatische verdunning' niet - Dit is de Dag|website=NPO Radio 1}}</ref> and in an interview he said he wants to preserve the native cultures and ethnicities of Europe as they are.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=DpBzt9PyU5w|title=Thierry Baudet: "Ik wil graag dat Europa dominant blank, en cultureel blijft zoals het is."|last=Allochtoons|date=22 September 2017|via=YouTube}}</ref> He is opposed to [[Ukraine]] joining the [[European Union]]. Forum for Democracy set up the [[2016 Dutch Ukraine–European Union Association Agreement referendum]] with the [[GeenStijl]] website and the Burgercomité EU association, in which Baudet voted no.<ref>{{Cite web|url= http://www.nrc.nl/next/2016/03/07/ze-delen-weinig-behalve-een-diepe-afkeer-van-euro-1596081|title=Ze delen weinig, behalve een diepe afkeer van Europa|access-date= 20 March 2016|date= 7 March 2016 |publisher=[[NRC Handelsblad]]|language=nl

In November 2016 Baudet co-signed a letter initiated by the German journalist [[Billy Six]] which requested [[Donald Trump]] to press for a new investigation regarding [[Malaysia Airlines Flight 17]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/gs-b2d43e0b|title=Baudet vraagt Trump om nieuw onderzoek naar MH17, nabestaanden geschokt|first=Robert van der|last=Noordaa|date=31 January 2017|website=de Volkskrant}}</ref> In 2020 his WhatsApp chats were leaked to media, revealing close contacts with Vladimir Kornilov demonstrating significant influence Kornilov had on Baudet's actions on Ukraine, the referendum and future anti-NATO campaigns. In the chats with his FvD colleagues Baudet also alluded to financial support from Kornilov. Baudet disagreed with the conclusions drawn from these texts and said that the text messages were quoted out of context.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://euobserver.com/foreign/148099|title=WhatsApp leak exposes Russia link to Dutch far right|website=EUobserver|language=en|access-date=2020-04-18}}</ref>

Baudet has a strong opinion on [[art]]s, the topic of his book ''[[Oikofobie]]'', and considers non-Western art and Western post-1900 [[modernism]] in [[visual arts]] inferior to Western [[Realism (arts)|Realism]], encourages education and programmation of [[tonal music]] opposed to [[atonal music]] and dislikes modern post-1950 [[architecture]]. In reaction to this, [[Musicology|Musicologist]] [[Yuri Landman]] warned Baudet for approaching the concept of [[degenerate art]] with his conservative criticism.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://frnkfrt.net/de-muzikale-dyslexie-van-thierry-baudet-c63753eede31|title=De Muzikale Dyslexie van Thierry Baudet|first=Yuri|last=Landman|date=27 March 2017|website=frnkfrt.net/}}</ref>

Baudet frequently speaks about the perceived existence of a "party cartel", in which the main ruling parties of the country divide power among themselves and conspire towards the same goals, despite claiming to be competitors.<ref name=FT>{{cite web|url=https://www.ft.com/content/4520bb4c-07e3-11e7-97d1-5e720a26771b|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|date=14 March 2017|title=Populists seize the moment as Dutch fall out of love with EU|author=Joshua Chaffin}}</ref> Baudet is not religious, but he is sympathetic to [[Christianity|Christian]] values. In an interview, he called himself an "[[agnostic]] [[cultural Christian]]."<ref>{{in lang|nl}} [https://cip.nl/60959-thierry-baudet-pleit-voor-herwaardering-christendom Thierry Baudet pleit voor herwaardering christendom], ''cip.nl'', 15 February 2017</ref>

Baudet believes that the [[MH17]] flight was shot down by Ukrainians and not by Russians.<ref name="Volkskrant">{{citation|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/columns-opinie/complotdenken-typeert-baudet-beter-dan-antisemitisme~b85035c4/|publisher=Volkskrant|title=Complotdenken typeert Baudet beter dan antisemitisme|date=4 December 2020}}</ref>

Baudet is critical of [[Islam]] and has expressed concern about both high levels and lack of assimilation of migrants from Islamic societies. He has stated his disagreement with the proposals made by fellow Dutch politician [[Geert Wilders]] to ban copies of the [[Koran]]. Meanwhile he also praised Wilders as someone who "has put on the agenda the significant problem that we have with radical Islam in our time and Muslim immigration." Baudet has called for Islamic schools in the Netherlands to sign up with Western values. He has criticised both Dutch, and wider European handling of immigration and assimilation. During the [[2017 Dutch general election]] Baudet was one of the few Dutch politicians who said he would form a coalition with Wilders' [[Party for Freedom]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.spiked-online.com/2017/03/14/the-dutch-are-sick-of-being-lied-to/|title='The Dutch are sick of being lied to': Meet the man hoping to be kingmaker in the Dutch elections |first=Tom |last=Slater |date=14 March 2017 |newspaper=[[Spiked (magazine)|Spiked]]}}</ref> Baudet has also expressed admiration for Dutch politician [[Pim Fortuyn]] and both ideological and personality comparisons between the two men have been made by both Dutch and foreign media.<ref>https://www.resetdoc.org/story/dandy-thierry-baudet-new-dutch-populism-interview-sarah-de-lange/</ref><ref>https://www.dw.com/en/thierry-baudet-the-new-face-of-the-euroskeptic-dutch-right/a-48012429</ref>

In February 2018, Baudet was confronted with the question whether there is a relation between [[Race and intelligence|IQ and race]] in a debate with [[Femke Halsema]]. Hiddema and the number two on Baudet's party list for the [[2018 Dutch municipal elections]] in Amsterdam, Yernaz Ramautarsing, stated they believed it to be true while Baudet refused to answer the question. Deputy Prime Minister [[Kajsa Ollongren]] stated that Forum for Democracy is a bigger threat than the [[Party for Freedom]] and that members have an unhealthy fascination for race differences; Baudet made a complaint for [[defamation]] at an Amsterdam police station. Hiddema supported him as his [[advocate]].<ref>[https://www.telegraaf.nl/nieuws/1624498/baudet-aangifte-wegens-smaad-en-laster Baudet aangifte small en laster] (in Dutch), ''[[De Telegraaf]]''.</ref>

Baudet is an adherent of the [[Cultural Marxism conspiracy theory]]<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.nporadio1.nl/opinie-commentaar/5538-de-term-cultuur-marxisme-leidt-alleen-maar-tot-verwarring|publisher=[[NPO Radio 1]]|language=nl|access-date=23 May 2019|title=De term 'Cultureel Marxisme' leidt alleen maar tot verwarring |date=29 August 2017|first=Arend Jan|last=Boekestijn}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.trouw.nl/religie-en-filosofie/met-cultuur-marxisme-kun-je-alle-kanten-op~acd5fef6/|newspaper=[[Trouw]]|language=nl|access-date=23 May 2019|title=Met cultuur-marxisme kun je alle kanten op |date=1 May 2019|first=Leonie|last=Breebaart}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.volkskrant.nl/nieuws-achtergrond/er-is-een-complot-tegen-de-europese-mens-gaande~b79612f9/?referer=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.google.com%2F|newspaper=[[de Volkskrant]]|language=nl|access-date=23 May 2019|title='Er is een complot tegen de Europese mens gaande'|date=1 May 2019|first=Peter|last=Giesen}}</ref> that suggests a calculated effort to destroy Western culture by academic and intellectual means.<ref>{{cite web|title=Skidmore College: Column: Force Fields|url=http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/backissues/168-169/martin-jay-frankfurt-school-as-scapegoat.cfm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111124045123/http://cms.skidmore.edu/salmagundi/backissues/168-169/martin-jay-frankfurt-school-as-scapegoat.cfm|url-status=dead|archive-date=2011-11-24|date=2011-11-24|access-date=2019-03-23}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=The post-war Anglo-American far right : a special relationship of hate|editor=Jackson, Paul|editor2=Shekhovtsov, Anton|isbn=9781137396211|location=Basingstoke|oclc=890161379}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Cultures of Post-War British Fascism|editor=Copsey, Nigel|editor2=Richardson, John E.|isbn=9781138846838|oclc=890758276}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|title='Cultural Marxism' Catching On|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/2003/cultural-marxism-catching|work=Southern Poverty Law Center|access-date=2019-03-23|language=en}}</ref> Baudet accuses the [[European Union]] of being 'a Cultural Marxist project, with the aim of destroying European Civilization'.<ref name=":0">{{cite tweet |user=thierrybaudet |author=Thierry Baudet|number= 899162815176605696|date=2018-04-23|title= Twitter: "Omdat de Europese Unie een cultuurmarxistisch project is dat tot doel heeft de vernietiging van de Europese beschaving.… https://t.co/viDjPlokSR" |archive-date=23 April 2018 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180423110527/https://twitter.com/thierrybaudet/status/899162815176605696|work=web.archive.org |accessdate=2019-03-23}}</ref>

Baudet has allegedly also stated that [[COVID-19]] was introduced by [[George Soros]] to "steal freedom", a claim he denies. He has also alledgedly said [[anti-Semetic]] comments. Following these claims in November 2020 published by a Dutch senator, Baudet resigned as leader of the party and the party alledgedly split.<ref name="Volkskrant"/><ref>https://www.dutchnews.nl/news/2020/12/thierry-baudet-wins-popular-vote-to-stay-on-as-leader-of-far-right-fvd/</ref>
