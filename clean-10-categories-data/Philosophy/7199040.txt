'''The Ghost Club''' is a [[paranormal investigation]] and research organization, founded in London in 1862.<ref name=Underwood>Peter Underwood (1978) "Dictionary of the Supernatural", Harrap Ltd., London, {{ISBN|0-245-52784-2}}, Page 144</ref> It is widely believed to be the oldest such organization in the world.<ref name=Underwood/> Since 1862 it has primarily investigated [[ghost|ghosts and hauntings]].

==History==

The club has its roots in [[Cambridge]] in 1855, where [[Fellow#Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin|fellows]] at [[Trinity College, Cambridge|Trinity College]] began to discuss [[ghost]]s and [[Parapsychology|psychic phenomena]]. Launched officially in London in 1862, it counted [[Charles Dickens]] and [[Sir Arthur Conan Doyle]] among its members.<ref name=brock440>{{cite book | title=William Crookes (1832-1919) and the commercialization of science | series=Science, technology, and culture, 1700-1945 | author=William Hodson Brock | publisher=Ashgate Publishing | year=2008 | isbn=0-7546-6322-1 | page=440 }}</ref> One of the club's earliest [[Ghost hunting|investigations]] was of the [[Davenport brothers]] and their "spirit cabinet" [[hoax]], the club challenging the Davenports' claim of contacting the dead.

The group continued to undertake practical investigations of [[Spiritualism|spiritualist]] phenomena, a topic then in vogue, meeting to discuss ghostly subjects. The Ghost Club dissolved in the 1870s following the death of Dickens.{{Citation needed|date=February 2016}}

===1882 revitalisation===

The club was revived on [[All Saints Day]] 1882 by the medium [[Stainton Moses]] and [[Alaric Alfred Watts]].<ref name=brock440/> initially claiming to be the original founders, without acknowledging its origins.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ghostclub.org.uk/history.html|title=The Ghost Club History|publisher="Ghost Club" }}</ref> In 1882, the [[Society for Psychical Research]] (SPR), with whom there was an initial overlap, was founded at a similar time.<ref name=brock440/><ref>[[Janet Oppenheim|Oppenheim, Janet]]. (1988). ''The Other World: Spiritualism and Psychical Research in England, 1850-1914''. Cambridge University Press. p. 138. {{ISBN|978-0521347679}} "Moses became one of the first vice-presidents and council members of the SPR"</ref>

While the SPR was a body devoted to scientific study, the Ghost Club remained a selective and secretive organization of [[Spiritualism|convinced believers]] for whom psychic phenomena were an established fact.<ref name=brock440/> Stainton Moses resigned from the vice presidency of the SPR in 1886 and thereafter devoted himself to the Ghost Club. Membership was small (82 members over 54 years{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}) and women were not allowed but during this period it attracted some of the most original and controversial minds in psychical research. These included Sir [[William Crookes]]<ref>{{cite book | title=The spiritualists: the story of Florence Cook and William Crookes | first=Trevor H. | last=Hall | publisher=Helix Press | year=1963 | page=97n }}</ref> Sir [[Oliver Lodge]], [[Nandor Fodor]] and Sir [[Arthur Conan Doyle]].

The archives{{Clarify|date=February 2016}} of the Club reveal that the names of members, both living and dead, were solemnly recited each November 2. Each individual, living or dead, was recognized a member of the Club. On more than one occasion deceased members were believed to have made their presence felt.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

Also involved were the poet [[W. B. Yeats]] (joined 1911) and [[Frederick Bligh Bond]] (joined 1925), who became infamous with his investigations into spiritualism at [[Glastonbury]]. Bligh Bond later left the country and became active in the [[American Society for Psychical Research]]. He was ordained into the [[Old Catholic Church]] and rejoined the Ghost Club on his return to Britain in 1935.

The Principal of [[Jesus College, Cambridge]], [[Arthur Gray (Master of Jesus)|Arthur Grey]], fictionalized the Ghost Club in 1919 as "The Everlasting Club"<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gutenberg.net.au/ebooks06/0605771h.html |title=Read "The Everlasting Club" |publisher=Project Gutenberg Australia }}</ref> in a ghost story that many still believe to be true.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ash-tree.bc.ca/atp134tediousbrieftales.htm |title="Tedious Brief Tales of Granta and Gramarye" by Arthur Grey |publisher=Ash-Tree Press }}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mythosbooks.com/?page=shop/flypage&product_id=54807&CLSN_23=1246353232238b39aa06f9d73fa1f62e |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714145228/http://www.mythosbooks.com/?page=shop%2Fflypage&product_id=54807&CLSN_23=1246353232238b39aa06f9d73fa1f62e |url-status=dead |archive-date=2011-07-14 |title="Tedious Brief Tales of Granta and Gramarye" by Arthur Grey |publisher=Mythos Books }}</ref>

===Early 20th century===

The 20th century's move from [[s√©ance]] room investigation to laboratory-based research meant the Ghost Club fell out of touch with contemporary psychic research. [[Harry Price]], famous for his investigation into [[Borley Rectory]], joined as a member in 1927 as did psychologist [[Nandor Fodor]] who represented the changing approach to psychical research taking place.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/the-ghost-club-a-history-by-peter-underwood.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-05-28 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130703003858/http://www.mysteriousbritain.co.uk/the-ghost-club-a-history-by-peter-underwood.html |archive-date=2013-07-03 }}</ref> With attendance falling, the club closed in 1936 after 485 meetings. The Ghost Club records were deposited in the [[British Museum]] under the proviso that they would remain closed until 1962 out of respect for confidentiality.<ref name=brock440/>

Within 18 months, Price relaunched the Ghost Club as a society dining event where psychic researchers and mediums delivered after-dinner talks. Price decided to admit women to the club, also specifying that it was not a spiritualist church or association but a group of [[Skepticism|skeptics]] that gathered to discuss paranormal topics. Members in this period included {{nowrap|[[C. E. M. Joad]]}}, Sir [[Julian Huxley]], [[Algernon Blackwood]], Sir [[Osbert Sitwell]] and [[Frederick Montague, 1st Baron Amwell|Lord Amwell]].

Following Price's death in 1948, the club was again relaunched by members of the committee, Philip Paul and [[Peter Underwood (parapsychologist)|Peter Underwood]]. From 1962 Underwood served as President; many accounts of club activities are found in his books.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In the early 1960s two young men, Theodore Cary and Patrick Hewitt, brought the club back to national prominence, when they established a chapter in [[Harrison Township, Michigan]].{{cn|date=January 2020}}

Tom Perrott joined the club in 1967 and served as Chairman from 1971 to 1993.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}

In 1993, the club underwent a period of internal disruption, during which Underwood left to become Life President of another society he had revived called "The Ghost Club Society".<ref>[http://www.castleofspirits.com/ghostclub.html The Ghost Club Society] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141216181942/http://www.castleofspirits.com/ghostclub.html |date=2014-12-16 }}</ref>

The Ghost Club later expanded its remit to include the study of [[UFO]]s, [[dowsing]], [[cryptozoology]] and similar topics.

===Recent history===

In 1998, Perrott resigned as chairman (although he remained active in club affairs), and [[barrister]] Alan Murdie was elected as his successor. Murdie has written a number of ghost books including ''Haunted [[Brighton]]''<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.britishlocalhistory.co.uk/Default.aspx?tabid=8770&ProductID=1114 |title=Haunted Brighton |publisher=British Local History |ISBN=978-0-7524-3829-0 }}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}</ref> and regularly writes for ''[[Fortean Times]]''.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.forteantimes.com/strangedays/ghostwatch/1035/yorkshire_ghost_busters.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080314220116/http://www.forteantimes.com/strangedays/ghostwatch/1035/yorkshire_ghost_busters.html |url-status=dead |archive-date=2008-03-14 |title="Fortean Times" article by Alan Murdie |publisher=Fortean Times |date=March 2008 }}</ref> In 2005 he was succeeded by Kathy Gearing, the club's first female chairperson. Gearing announced her resignation in the club's Summer 2009 newsletter.<ref>The Ghost Club newsletter, Summer 2009, page 2</ref>

The club continues to meet monthly at the Victory Services Club near [[Marble Arch]], in London. Several investigations are performed in England every year. In recent times, investigations have been organised in [[Scotland]] by the club's Scottish Area Investigation Coordinator.{{citation needed|date=February 2016}}
