In [[philosophy]], '''anamnesis''' ({{IPAc-en|ˌ|æ|n|æ|m|ˈ|n|iː|s|ɪ|s}}; {{lang-grc|ἀνάμνησις}}) is a concept in [[Plato]]'s [[epistemology|epistemological]] and psychological theory that he develops in his [[dialogue]]s ''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'' and alludes to in his ''[[Phaedrus (dialogue)|Phaedrus]]''.

The idea is that humans possess innate knowledge (perhaps acquired before birth) and that learning consists of rediscovering that knowledge from within.

==''Meno''==
In ''Meno'', Plato's character (and old teacher) [[Socrates]] is challenged by Meno with what has become known as the [[Sophism|sophistic]] paradox, or the paradox of knowledge:

:Meno:  And how are you going to search for [the nature of virtue] when you don't know at all what it is, Socrates?  Which of all the things you don't know will you set up as target for your search?  And even if you actually come across it, how will you know that it ''is'' that thing which you don't know?<ref>''[[Meno (Plato)|Meno]]'' 80d</ref>

In other words, one who knows none of the attributes, properties, and/or other descriptive markers of any kind that help signify what something is (physical or otherwise) will not recognize it even after coming across it. Therefore, if the converse is true, and one knows the attributes, properties and/or other descriptive markers of this thing, one should not need to seek it out at all. The conclusion is that in either instance, there is no point trying to gain that "something"; in the case of Plato's aforementioned work, there is no point in seeking knowledge.

Socrates' response is to develop his theory of ''anamnesis'' and to suggest that the [[Soul (spirit)|soul]] is immortal, and repeatedly [[metempsychosis|incarnated]]; knowledge is in the soul from eternity (86b), but each time the soul is incarnated its knowledge is forgotten in the trauma of birth. What one perceives to be learning, then, is the recovery of what one has forgotten. (Once it has been brought back it is true belief, to be turned into genuine knowledge by understanding.) Socrates (and Plato) thus sees himself not as a teacher but as a [[Maieutics|midwife]], aiding with the birth of knowledge that was already there in the student.

The theory is illustrated by Socrates asking a slave boy questions about geometry. At first, the boy gives the wrong answer; when that is pointed out to him, he is puzzled, but by asking questions, Socrates helps him to reach the correct answer. That is intended to show that since the boy was not told the answer, he reached the truth by only recollecting what he had once known but later forgotten.

==''Phaedo''==
In ''[[Phaedo]]'', Plato develops his theory of ''anamnesis'', in part by combining it with his theory of [[Idea#Plato|Form]]s.  Firstly, he elaborates how ''anamnesis'' can be achieved: whereas in ''Meno'', nothing more than Socrates' method of questioning is offered, in ''Phaedo'', Plato presents a way of living that would enable one to overcome the misleading nature of the body through ''[[catharsis|katharsis]]'' (Greek: κάθαρσις; “cleansing” (from guilt or defilement), “purification”). The body and its senses are the source of error; knowledge cannot be regained except through the use of reason, contemplating things with the soul ([[noesis]]) (see 66 b–d).

Secondly, Plato clarifies that genuine knowledge, as opposed to mere true belief ([[doxa]]), is distinguished by its content.  One can know only eternal truths since they are the only truths that possibly were in the soul from eternity. It may be very useful to have a true belief about, say, the best way to get from [[London]] to [[Oxford]], such a belief does not qualify as knowledge; how could the human soul know such factually [[contingent propositions]] for all eternity?

==Neoplatonism==
For later interpreters of Plato, the concept of ''anamnesis'' became less [[epistemic]] and more [[ontological]]. [[Plotinus]] himself did not posit recollection in the strict sense of the term because all knowledge of universally important ideas ([[logos]]) came from a source outside of time (Dyad or the divine [[nous]]) and was accessible, by means of contemplation, to the soul as part of [[noesis]]. They were more objects of experience, of [[noesis|inner knowledge]] or [[insight]], than of recollection. However, in [[Neoplatonism]], the theory of ''anamnesis'' became part of the mythology of the descent of the soul.

[[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]]'s short work ''De Antro Nympharum'' (ostensibly a commentary on the brief passage in  ''Odyssey'' 13) elucidated that notion, as did [[Macrobius]]'s much longer ''Commentary on the Dream of Scipio''. The idea of psychic memory was used by Neoplatonists to demonstrate the celestial and immaterial origins of the soul, and to explain how memories of the world-soul could be recalled by everyday human beings. As such, psychic recollection was intrinsically connected to the Platonic conception of the soul itself. Since the contents of individual "material" or physical memories were trivial, only the universal recollection of Forms, or divine objects, drew one closer to the immortal source of being.

''Anamnesis'' is the closest that human minds can come to experiencing the freedom of the soul before it is encumbered by matter. The process of incarnation is described in Neoplatonism as a trauma that causes the soul to forget its experiences (and often its divine origins as well). The storyteller's voice is concealed by John and Plato in order to pursue their anamnetic efforts and to encourage the following generations to be not only readers but also partakers in their original discussions on the soul.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Parsenios |first1=George L. |title=Anamnesis and the Silent Narrator in Plato and John |date=March 2017 |page=1 }}</ref> Gratitude, as an example of divine salvation, was expressed by offering to God the first fruits of the harvest which maintains an identity with those who performed these actions in the past and therefore actualising them in the present.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Cody|first=Alfred|date=January 2006|title=Little Historical Creed or little Historical Anamnesis|journal=The Catholic Biblical Quarterly|volume=Jan 2006|pages=9}}</ref>
