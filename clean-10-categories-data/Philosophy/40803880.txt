The '''Society for Women in Philosophy''' was created in 1972 to support and promote women in philosophy. Since that time the Society for Women in Philosophy or "SWIP" has expanded to many branches around the world, including in the US, Canada, Ireland, the UK, the Netherlands, Flanders, and Germany. SWIP organizations worldwide hold meetings and lectures that aim to support women in philosophy; some, such as SWIPshop, focus exclusively on feminist philosophy, while others, such as SWIP-Analytic, focus on women philosophers working in other areas.<ref name="uh.edu">SWIP Website http://www.uh.edu/~cfreelan/SWIP/hist.html</ref><ref>[http://swipanalytic.commons.gc.cuny.edu/about/ About – SWIP-Analytic Workshop Series<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref><ref>[http://nyswip.tumblr.com/ New York Society for Women in Philosophy<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> One of the founding members of the Society for Women in Philosophy was [[Alison Jaggar]], who was also one of the first people to introduce feminist concerns into philosophy.<ref name=apacsw>{{cite web|last=DeSautels|first=Peggy|title=Alison Jaggar: April 2013|url=http://www.apaonlinecsw.org/home/woman_philosopher/alisonjaggarapril2013|work=Highlighted Philosophers|publisher=American Philosophical Association|accessdate=18 August 2013}}</ref> Each year, one philosopher is named the Distinguished Woman Philosopher of the Year by the Society for Women in Philosophy.<ref>[http://leiterreports.typepad.com/blog/2013/03/call-for-nominations-distinguished-woman-philosopher-2013-kukla.html Leiter Reports: A Philosophy Blog: Call for Nominations: Distinguished Woman Philosopher 2013 (Kukla)<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref>

==Archive==

Some SWIP archive records were originally housed in the Sophia Smith Collection at the [[Smith College]] library (started in 1982 by [[Kathryn Pyne Addelson|Kathy Pyne Parsons Addelson]] following the 10th anniversary of SWIP). The official SWIP Archive will now be permanently housed in the Feminist Theory Archive, Pembroke Center, [[Brown University]]. The new SWIP home is the product of the efforts of the Feminist Philosophy Archive Project created in June 2013 and ending in July 2014. The main goal of the FPA Project team, composed of philosophers Joan Callahan, Ann Garry, Alison Jaggar, Sandra Harding, Christina Rawls, and Samantha Noll, was to locate and organize the best possible professional archive for over four decades of SWIP records to be preserved. As of December 2014, the American Philosophical Association awarded the Feminist Theory Archive, SWIP, and the FPAP organizing team financial assistance to aid in the processing and preservation of SWIP materials donated.<ref>{{cite web | title = SWIP Donor Information | url = http://www.brown.edu/research/pembroke-center/archives/feminist-theory-archives/swip-donor-information | publisher = [[Brown University]] }}</ref>

==Events==

In the 1980s, while a graduate student at the [[City University of New York Graduate Center]], Mary Ellen Waithe, now professor of philosophy and interim director of Women's Studies at [[Cleveland State University]], "came upon a reference to a work by Aegidius Menagius, Historia Mullierum Philosopharum, published in 1690 and 1692. [Waithe] had never heard of any women philosophers prior to the 20th century with the exceptions of Queen Christina of Sweden, known as Descartes' student, and Hildegard von Bingen, who lived in the 12th century." <ref name="amazon.com">A History of Women Philosophers: Ancient Women Philosophers 600 B.C. – 500 A.D. https://www.amazon.com/History-Women-Philosophers-Ancient-B-C/dp/9024733685</ref> After she obtained a copy of this book, she discovered that "many of the women [Menagius] listed as philosophers were astronomers, astrologers, gynecologists, or simply relatives of male philosophers. Nevertheless, the list of women alleged to have been philosophers was impressive." <ref name="amazon.com"/> At this point, she decided to "create a team of experts to collaborate with...I placed a notice in the SWIP (Society for Women in Philosophy) Newsletter and received a half-dozen responses from philosophers".<ref name="amazon.com"/> This collaborative project led to the publication of the four-volume ''A History of Women Philosophers'', published 1987–1995, which includes the following sections:

* Volume 1, ''Ancient Women Philosophers'' (1987) 600 BC-500 AD, Aspasia of Miletus, Diotima of Mantinea, Julia Domna, Makrina, and Hypatia of Alexandria.<ref name="amazon.com"/>

At the 2002 conference for Canadian Society for Women in Philosophy, Dr. [[Nancy Tuana]] asserted the evolutionary theory that the clitoris is unnecessary in reproduction and therefore it has been "historically ignored," mainly because of "a fear of pleasure. It is pleasure separated from reproduction. That's the fear". She reasoned that this fear is the cause of the ignorance that veils female sexuality.<ref name="Cairney">{{cite web|last=Cairney|first=Richard|title=Exploring female sexuality|publisher=ExpressNews|date=October 21, 2002|accessdate=December 21, 2011|url=http://www.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article.cfm?id=3201|archivedate=December 21, 2011|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111221175533/http://www.archives.expressnews.ualberta.ca/article/2002/10/3201.html}}</ref> The received view, advanced by [[Stephen Jay Gould]] suggests that [[muscle contraction|muscular contractions]] associated with orgasms pull sperm from the vagina to the [[cervix]], where it is in a better position to reach the egg. Dr. Tuana's proposal challenged the view previously accepted by male biologists.<ref name="Gould">{{cite book | author= Stephen Jay Gould | author-link= Stephen Jay Gould | title = The Structure of Evolutionary Theory | publisher =[[Harvard University Press]]|year = 2002|pages=1262–1263| isbn = 0674006135|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=nhIl7e61WOUC&pg=PA767}}</ref>
