The '''world''' is the [[Earth]] and all [[life]] on it, including [[civilization|human civilization]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090423111522/http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/world|url-status=dead|title=Definition of WORLD|archivedate=23 April 2009|website=www.merriam-webster.com}}</ref> In a philosophical context, the "world" is the whole of the physical [[Universe]], or an [[Ontology|ontological]] world (the "world" of an [[individual]]). In a theological context, the ''world'' is the material or the profane sphere, as opposed to the celestial, spiritual, transcendent or sacred spheres. "[[Eschatology|End of the world]]" scenarios refer to the end of human history, often in religious contexts.

The [[Human history|history of the world]] is commonly understood as the history of humanity spanning the major [[Geopolitics|geopolitical]] developments of about five millennia, from the [[Cradle of civilization|first civilization]] to the present. In terms such as [[world religion]], [[world language]], [[world government]], and [[world war]], the term ''world'' suggests an international or intercontinental scope without necessarily implying participation of every part of the world.

The [[world population]] is the sum of all human populations at any time; similarly, the [[world economy]] is the sum of the economies of all societies or countries, especially in the context of [[Globalization|globalization]]. Terms such as "[[world championship]]", "[[gross world product]]", and "[[world flags]]" imply the sum or combination of all [[sovereign state]]s.

== Etymology and usage ==
The [[English language|English]] word ''[[:wikt:world|world]]'' comes from the [[Old English]] ''weorold (-uld), weorld, worold (-uld, -eld)'', a compound of ''[[were|wer]]'' "man" and ''eld'' "age," which thus means roughly "Age of Man."<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.bartleby.com/|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080512075921/http://www.bartleby.com/61/roots/IE588.html|url-status=dead|title=Homework Help and Textbook Solutions &#124; bartleby|archivedate=12 May 2008|website=www.bartleby.com}}</ref>

The Old English is a reflex of the [[Common Germanic]] ''*wira-alđiz'', also reflected in [[Old Saxon]] ''werold'', [[Old Dutch]] ''werilt'', [[Old High German]] ''weralt'', [[Old Frisian]] ''warld'' and [[Old Norse]] ''verǫld'' (whence the [[Icelandic language|Icelandic]] ''[[wikt:en:veröld|veröld]]'').<ref>Orel, Vladimir (2003) ''A Handbook of Germanic Etymology'' Leiden: Brill. p. 462 {{ISBN|90-04-12875-1}}</ref>

The corresponding word in [[Latin]] is ''mundus'', literally "clean, elegant", itself a loan translation of Greek ''[[cosmos]]'' "orderly arrangement". While the Germanic word thus reflects a mythological notion of a "domain of Man" (compare [[Midgard]]), presumably as opposed to the divine sphere on the one hand and the [[chthonic]] sphere of the underworld on the other, the Greco-Latin term expresses a notion of [[Creation myth|creation]] as an act of establishing order out of [[chaos (cosmogony)|chaos]].

"World" distinguishes the entire [[planet]] or [[population]] from any particular [[country]] or [[region]]: ''world affairs'' pertain not just to one place but to the whole world, and ''[[world history]]'' is a field of [[history]] that examines events from a global (rather than a national or a regional) perspective. ''Earth'', on the other hand, refers to the planet as a physical entity, and distinguishes it from other planets and physical objects.

"World" was also classically used to mean the material universe, or the cosmos: "The worlde is an apte frame of heauen and earthe, and all other naturall thinges contained in them".<ref>{{cite book|first=R |last=Record|year=1556|title=Castle of Knowledge}} cited in {{cite book|title=The Oxford English Dictionary|at=World, sense 8|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/230262?rskey=BRZMwD|url-access=subscription}}</ref> The earth was often described as "the center of the world".<ref>e.g. {{cite book|author=Sacrobosco|title=Treatise on the Sphere|year=1230|at=trans by Lynn Thorndike, 1949 |url=http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|url-status=live|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130519151919/http://www.esotericarchives.com/solomon/sphere.htm|archive-date=2013-05-19}}</ref>

The term can also be used attributively, to mean "global", or "relating to the whole world", forming usages such as [[world community]] or world canonical texts.<ref>[http://lawpark.jimdo.com''World Canonical Texts'']</ref>

By extension, a ''world'' may refer to any planet or [[heavenly body]], especially when it is thought of as inhabited, especially in the context of [[science fiction]] or [[Futures studies|futurology]].

''World'', in its original sense, when qualified, can also refer to a particular domain of [[human]] [[experience]].

* The ''world of work'' describes paid work and the pursuit of a [[career]], in all its social aspects, to distinguish it from home life and [[Academy|academic]] study.
* The ''fashion world'' describes the environment of the designers, [[Fashion design|fashion house]]s and [[consumer]]s that make up the [[Fashion|fashion industry]].
* Historically, the ''[[New World]]'' versus the ''[[Old World]]'', referring to the parts of the world colonised in the wake of the [[Age of Discovery]]. Now mostly used in [[zoology]] and [[botany]], as in [[New World monkey]].

== Philosophy ==
[[File:The Garden of Earthly Delights by Bosch High Resolution.jpg|thumb|270px|upright=1.35|''[[The Garden of Earthly Delights]]'' triptych by [[Hieronymus Bosch]] ({{Circa|1503}}) shows the "garden" of mundane pleasures flanked by [[Paradise]] and [[Hell]].

The exterior panel shows the world before the appearance of humanity, depicted as a [[Flat Earth|disc]] enclosed in a [[Firmament|sphere]].]]

In philosophy, the term ''world'' has several possible meanings. In some contexts, it refers to everything that makes up [[reality]] or the physical [[universe]]. In others, it can mean have a specific [[ontology|ontological]] sense (see [[world disclosure]]). While clarifying the [[concept]] of world has arguably always been among the basic tasks of [[Western philosophy]], this theme appears to have been raised explicitly only at the start of the twentieth century<ref>{{cite book|last=Heidegger|first=Martin|title=Basic Problems of Phenomenology|location=Bloomington|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1982 |page=[https://archive.org/details/basicproblemsofp00mart/page/165 165]|isbn=0-253-17686-7|url-access=registration|url=https://archive.org/details/basicproblemsofp00mart/page/165}}</ref> and has been the subject of continuous debate. The question of what the world is has by no means been settled.

=== Parmenides ===
The traditional interpretation of [[Parmenides]]' work is that he argued that the everyday perception of reality of the physical world (as described in ''[[Parmenides#The Way of Opinion|doxa]]'') is mistaken, and that the reality of the world is 'One Being' (as described in aletheia): an unchanging, ungenerated, indestructible whole.

=== Plato ===
In his [[Allegory of the cave]], [[Plato]] distinguishes between forms and ideas and imagines two distinct worlds: the sensible world and the intelligible world.

=== Hegel ===
In [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel]]'s [[philosophy of history]], the expression ''Weltgeschichte ist Weltgericht'' (World History is a tribunal that judges the World) is used to assert the view that History is what judges men, their actions and their opinions. Science is born from the desire to transform the World in relation to Man; its final end is technical application.

=== Schopenhauer ===
''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'' is the central work of [[Arthur Schopenhauer]]. Schopenhauer saw the human will as our one window to the world behind the representation; the Kantian thing-in-itself. He believed, therefore, that we could gain knowledge about the thing-in-itself, something Kant said was impossible, since the rest of the relationship between representation and thing-in-itself could be understood by analogy to the relationship between human will and human body.

=== Wittgenstein ===
Two definitions that were both put forward in the 1920s, however, suggest the range of available opinion. "The world is everything that is the case," wrote [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]] in his influential ''[[Tractatus Logico-Philosophicus]]'', first published in 1921.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/wittgenstein/|title=Ludwig Wittgenstein|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy |editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|date=3 March 2014|access-date=3 December 2017|first1=Anat|first2=Anat|last1=Biletzki|last2=Matar|edition=Fall 2016}}</ref> This definition would serve as the basis of [[logical positivism]], with its assumption that there is exactly one world, consisting of the totality of facts, regardless of the interpretations that individual people may make of them.

=== Heidegger ===
[[Martin Heidegger]], meanwhile, argued that "the surrounding world is different for each of us, and notwithstanding that we move about in a common world".<ref>Heidegger (1982), p. 164</ref> The world, for Heidegger, was that into which we are always already "thrown" and with which we, as beings-in-the-world, must come to terms. His conception of "[[world disclosure]]" was most notably elaborated in his 1927 work ''[[Being and Time]]''.

=== Freud ===
In response, [[Sigmund Freud]] proposed that we do not move about in a common world, but a common thought process. He believed that all the actions of a person are motivated by one thing: lust. This led to numerous theories about reactionary consciousness.

=== Others ===
Some philosophers, often inspired by [[David Lewis (philosopher)|David Lewis]], argue that metaphysical concepts such as possibility, probability, and necessity are best analyzed by comparing ''the'' world to a range of [[possible world]]s; a view commonly known as [[modal realism]].

== Religion ==
{{Wikiquote|Worldliness}}
[[File:yggdrasil.jpg|thumb|270px|right|upright=1.35|[[Yggdrasil]], a modern attempt to reconstruct the Norse [[world tree]] which connects the [[heaven]]s, the world, and the [[underworld]].]]

[[Religious cosmology|Mythological cosmologies]] often depict the world as centered on an ''[[axis mundi]]'' and delimited by a boundary such as a [[Oceanus|world ocean]], a [[Jörmungandr|world serpent]] or similar. In some religions, worldliness (also called carnality)<ref>Hemer, C. J. "Worldly" Edited by Geoffrey W. Bromiley The International Standard Bible Encyclopedia, Revised Wm. B. Eerdmans, 1979–1988</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=Oxford English Dictionary Online|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2019|via=OED Online}}</ref> is that which relates to this world as opposed to other worlds or realms.

=== Buddhism ===
In [[Buddhism]], the world means society, as distinct from the [[monastery]]. It refers to the material world, and to worldly gain such as wealth, reputation, jobs, and war. The spiritual world would be the path to [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|enlightenment]], and changes would be sought in what we could call the psychological realm.

=== Christianity ===
In [[Christianity]], the term often connotes the concept of the [[Fall of man|fallen]] and corrupt world order of human society, in contrast to the [[World to come|World to Come]]. The world is frequently cited alongside ''the [[Flesh (theology)|flesh]]'' and ''the [[Devil]]'' as a source of [[temptation]] that Christians should flee. [[Monk]]s speak of striving to be "''in'' this world, but not ''of'' this world" — as [[Jesus]] said — and the term "worldhood" has been distinguished from "[[Monasticism|monkhood]]", the former being the status of merchants, princes, and others who deal with "worldly" things.

This view is clearly expressed by king [[Alfred the Great]] of England (d. 899) in his famous Preface to the ''[[Pastoral Care|Cura Pastoralis]]'':
{{quote|"Therefore I command you to do as I believe you are willing to do, that you free yourself from worldly affairs ''([[Old English]]: woruldðinga)'' as often as you can, so that wherever you can establish that wisdom that God gave you, you establish it. Consider what punishments befell us in this world when we neither loved wisdom at all ourselves, nor transmitted it to other men; we had the name alone that we were Christians, and very few had the practices".}}

Although Hebrew and Greek words meaning "world" are used in [[Religious text|Scripture]] with the normal variety of senses, many examples of its use in this particular sense can be found in the teachings of [[Jesus]] according to the [[Gospel of John]], e.g. 7:7, 8:23, 12:25, 14:17, 15:18-19, 17:6-25, 18:36. In contrast, a relatively newer concept is [[Catholic imagination]].

''[[Contemptus mundi]]'' is the name given to the belief that the world, in all its vanity, is nothing more than a futile attempt to hide from God by stifling our desire for the good and the holy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708140237/http://www.chastitysf.com/q_cm.htm|url-status=dead|title=Contemptus Mundi : Contempt of the world &#124; Catholic Christian Healing Psychology|archivedate=8 July 2011|website=www.chastitysf.com}}</ref> This view has been criticised as a "pastoral of fear" by modern historian [[Jean Delumeau]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605035017/http://www.ewtn.com/library/montfort/Handbook/Mission.htm|url-status=dead|title=Parish Missions|archivedate=5 June 2011}}</ref>

During the [[Second Vatican Council]], there was a novel attempt to develop a positive theological view of the World, which is illustrated by the pastoral optimism of the constitutions ''[[Gaudium et spes]]'', ''[[Lumen gentium]]'', ''[[Unitatis redintegratio]]'' and ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]''.

==== Eastern Christianity ====
In [[Eastern Christian monasticism]] or [[asceticism]], the world of mankind is driven by passions. Therefore, the passions of the World are simply called "the world". Each of these passions are a link to the world of mankind or order of human society. Each of these passions must be overcome in order for a person to receive salvation ([[Theosis (Eastern Christian theology)|Theosis]]). The process of Theosis is a personal relationship with God. This understanding is taught within the works of ascetics like [[Evagrius Ponticus]], and the most seminal ascetic works read most widely by [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Christians]], the [[Philokalia]] and [[The Ladder of Divine Ascent]] (the works of Evagrius and [[John Climacus]] are also contained within the Philokalia). At the highest level of world [[Transcendence (religion)|transcendence]] is [[hesychasm]] which culminates into the [[Christian contemplation|Vision of God]].

==== Orbis Catholicus ====
''Orbis Catholicus'' is a Latin phrase meaning ''Catholic world'', per the expression [[Urbi et Orbi]], and refers to that area of [[Christendom]] under [[papal supremacy]]. It is somewhat similar to the phrases secular world, Jewish world and [[Islamic world]].

=== Islam ===
{{Main|Dunya}}
''Dunya'' derives from the root word "dana" that means to bring near. In that sense, "dunya" is "what is brought near".<ref>Attas, Islam and Secularism, p.</ref>{{Page needed|date=August 2017}}

=== Hinduism ===
[[Hinduism]] is an [[Indian religion]] and ''[[dharma]]'', or a way of life, widely practised in the [[Indian subcontinent]]. It includes a number of Indian religious traditions with a loose sense of interconnection, as different from [[Jainism]] and [[Buddhism]], and (since medieval and modern times) [[Islam]] and [[Christianity]]. Hinduism has been called the oldest religion in the world.{{refn|group=note|See:
