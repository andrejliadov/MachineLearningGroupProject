{{short description|Stoic concept of equanimity or dispassion}}
'''Apatheia''' ({{lang-el|ἀπάθεια}}; from ''a-'' "without" and ''pathos'' "suffering" or "passion"), in [[Stoicism]], refers to a state of mind in which one is not disturbed by the [[passions (philosophy)|passions]]. It is best translated by the word [[equanimity]] rather than indifference. The meaning of the word ''apatheia'' is quite different from that of the modern English [[apathy]], which has a distinctly negative connotation. According to the Stoics, ''apatheia'' was the quality that characterized the [[sage (Sophos)|sage]].

Whereas [[Aristotle]] had claimed that [[virtue]] was to be found in the [[golden mean (philosophy)|golden mean]] between an excess and a deficiency of emotion (''metriopatheia''), the Stoics thought that living virtuously provided freedom from the [[Stoic passions|passions]], resulting in ''apatheia''.<ref>[https://iep.utm.edu/stoicism/#H4 Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy, "Apatheia and the Stoic Treatment of Emotions"]</ref> It meant eradicating the tendency to react emotionally or egotistically to external events, the things that cannot be controlled. For Stoics, it was the optimum rational response to the world, for things cannot be controlled if they are caused by the will of others or by Nature; only one's own will can be controlled. That did not mean a loss of feeling, or total disengagement from the world. The Stoic who performs correct (virtuous) judgments and actions as part of the world order experiences contentment (''[[eudaimonia]]'') and good feelings (''[[eupatheia]]'').

The term was later adopted by [[Plotinus]] in his development of [[Neoplatonism]], in which ''apatheia'' was the soul's freedom from emotion achieved when it reaches its purified state.

The term passed into [[early Christianity|early Christian]] teaching in which ''apatheia'' meant freedom from unruly urges or compulsions. It is still used in that sense in [[Eastern Orthodox Christian theology|Orthodox Christian spirituality]], and especially in [[Eastern Orthodox monasticism|monastic practice]].

''Apatheia'' is contrasted with ''[[ataraxia]]'', a related concept in [[Epicureanism]] and [[Pyrrhonism]], although some Latin Stoic authors, such as [[Seneca the Younger]] use the term interchangeably with ''apatheia''. In Epicureanism ataraxia comes from freedom from pain and fear. In Pyrrhonism it comes from the eradication of disturbing feelings that depend on beliefs about non-evident matters (i.e., [[dogma]]).
