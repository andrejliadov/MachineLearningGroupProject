'''Hans Albert''' (born 8 February 1921) is a [[Germany|German]] [[philosopher]]. Born in [[Cologne]], he lives in [[Heidelberg]].

His fields of research are Social Sciences and General Studies of Methods. He is a [[critical rationalist]], paying special attention to [[rationality|rational]] [[heuristics]]. He is a strong critic of the [[Continental philosophy|continental]] [[hermeneutic]] tradition coming from [[Heidegger]] and [[Gadamer]].

==Albert's critical rationalism==
Albert held the chair of Social Sciences and General Studies of Methods at the [[University of Mannheim]]. He is also a much-cited philosopher. Most importantly, he developed [[Karl Popper|Popper]]'s critical rationalism into a concise, broad-ranging [[Maxim (philosophy)|maxim]], thereby extending it from a method to progress in science to one equally applicable in day-to-day heuristics.

To substantiate his approach, he provided evidence for his thesis that there is no field of human activities where one should not be critical. Consequently, he advocated applying critical rationalism to the social sciences, especially to [[economics]], [[politics]], [[jurisprudence]], and [[religion]].

In his view the attitude of criticism is one of the oldest European traditions (going back to the [[pre-Socratics]]) in comparison with other less critical traditions.

Before his many books were published, Hans Albert was already known to a broader audience for his contributions to the [[positivism dispute]] arguing against his opponents of the so-called [[Frankfurt School]] (school of [[Theodor W. Adorno]] and [[Max Horkheimer]] at Frankfurt's Institute of Sociology). His contributions included
:* differentiating between [[critical rationalism]] and [[positivism]];
:* arguing against some strains of [[sociology]] opposing the application of methods used in [[natural sciences]];
:* suggesting that the role of [[values]] and the scientific handling of values has to be given new thought and
:* interpreting [[Max Weber]] not as supporting value-free science but as demonstrating that scientists can 'be free of any value judgement', even for research in the fields of values.

Albert observed that new insights are often difficult to spread or proliferate. He ascribed this phenomenon's cause to ideological obstacles, for which Albert coined the phrase 'immunity against criticism'.

Albert's well known [[Münchhausen trilemma]] is ironically named after [[Baron Munchausen]], who allegedly pulled himself out of a swamp seizing himself by his shock of hair. This trilemma rounds off the classical problem of [[Theory of justification|justification in the theory of knowledge]]. It concludes that all attempts to rationally justify or rather ultimately verify a thesis must inherently fail. This verdict concerns not only deductive justifications, as many of his critics believe, but also inductive, causal, transcendental, and all otherwise structured justifications. As Albert reasons, they all will be in vain, since a justification inevitably faces one of three flaws:
# All justification in pursuit of ''certain'' knowledge simultaneously has to justify the means of justification or rather the validity of its premises - an effort which leads to an [[infinite regress]].
# One can cut the chain of reasons short, for instance, by pointing to self-evidence or common sense or fundamental principles or another basic premise that shall not be further questioned. But in doing so the intention to arrive at a universally valid justification is abandoned, because the reasoning cannot be accepted, unless one (irrationally) accepts the validity of one premise for its own sake.
# The third horn of the trilemma is the equally unsatisfying application of a circular argument.

Albert stressed repeatedly that there is no limitation of the Münchhausen trilemma to [[deductive]] conclusions. Hence, Albert points out, justification is rendered virtually impossible regardless of the specific content of a thesis, justification is impossible at all. From this notion, Albert draws the conclusion that progress in science can only be achieved by means of [[Falsifiability|falsification]] rather than inductive verification.

To observe and criticize the endeavors made to escape from the quagmire of certain justification became an instructive part of Hans Albert's philosophy. A prominent example of these efforts  his discussion of the ideas of [[Karl-Otto Apel]], one of Germany's leading philosophers (see Albert's ''Transzendentale Träumereien...'' meaning ''Transcendental Reveries. Karl-Otto Apels Language Games and His Hermeneutical God'', which is not yet translated).

Still, Albert argues that critical rationalists have to accept that those attempts of rigorous justification (like Apel's) are not entirely futile, since only as long as alternative methods are without success can critical rationalism be called successful.

==Albert's style of writing and criticizing==
Albert's plea is for [[critical rationalism]]. He avoids solemn preaching in favor of serious, serene discussion with people of different faith and thinking. While Popper always warned not to follow one's opponent into the mire,{{citation needed|date=August 2013}} Albert follows them into their favored field of thinking on their own terms.  So he criticized [[Martin Heidegger|Heidegger's]] "being in the abyss" ("Sein im Ab-Grund"),<ref>Hans Albert, ''Kritik der reinen Hermeneutik &ndash; Der Antirealismus und das Problem des Verstehens'', Tübingen (Mohr Siebeck) 1994, chap. I</ref> [[Hans-Georg Gadamer|Gadamer's]] "horizons melting together",<ref>Hans Albert, ''Kritik der reinen Hermeneutik &ndash; Der Antirealismus und das Problem des Verstehens'', Tübingen (Mohr Siebeck) 1994, chap. II</ref> [[Jürgen Habermas|Habermas's]] "consensual theoretical truth in the ideal discourse",<ref>Hans Albert, ''Kritik der reinen Hermeneutik &ndash; Der Antirealismus und das Problem des Verstehens'', Tübingen (Mohr Siebeck) 1994, chap. VIII</ref> [[Karl-Otto Apel| Karl-Otto Apel's]] transcendental arguments,<ref>Hans Albert, ''Transzendentale Träumereien. Karl-Otto Apels Sprachspiele und sein hermeneutischer Gott'', Hamburg (Hoffmann und Campe) 1975; Hans Albert, ''Kritik des transzendentalen Denkens. Von der Begründung des Wissens zur Analyse der Erkenntnispraxis'', Tübingen (Mohr Siebeck) 2003</ref> the theologian [[Hans Küng| Hans Küng's]] "absolute-relative, this-life-and-hereafter, transcendental-immanent, allconcerning-allcontrolling most real reality in the very heart of things".<ref>Hans Albert, ''Das Elend der Theologie. Kritische Auseinandersetzung mit Hans Küng'', Hamburg (Hoffmann und Campe)1979; 2nd ed. Aschaffenburg (Alibri) 2005</ref> Hans Albert meticulously follows their arguments<ref>Much of the mentioned criticism is repeated in the English written Hans Albert, ''Between Social Science, Religion, and Politics. Essays on Critical Rationalism'', Amsterdam-Atlanta (Rodopi) 1999</ref> to uncover:
* undiscovered premises
* new and often fatal consequences
* new and often better alternatives.

Underlying suppositions and injunctions of Albert's method are: {{citation needed|date=June 2014}} 
* Only if all currently proposed alternatives to critical rationalism are untenable may one live with critical rationalism.
* There is value in keeping an open mind and learning from discussion. Other people may be right; thus give credit to their thinking.
* One should keep away from solemn gravity.
* One should avoid the moralising know-it-all but not conceal one's preferred way of life.

==The intellectual life of Hans Albert==
In 1950 Hans Albert earned his first degree as a 'Diplom-Kaufmann', followed by an Academic degree of a Dr. rer.pol. 1952.<ref>This and the following facts are taken from the books referred in the precedent chapter 'Biographical Books'.</ref> In the years 1952&ndash;1958 he worked as an assistant at the 'Forschungsinstitut für Sozial- und Verwaltungswissenschaften' of the University of Cologne. In 1957 he got the degree of a 'Dr. habil. for Social Politics' at the University of Cologne. As a lecturer he read [[logic]], [[theory of science]] and economics of the [[welfare state]]. Since 1958 he has been participating the Alpbacher Hochschulwochen (a summer conference in the Austrian alpine village of [[Alpbach]]). It was there he made the acquaintance of [[Karl Popper]] after having studied Popper's philosophy and having mostly accepted it long ago. After 1955 he had exciting discussions with [[Paul Feyerabend]], who in those times was a critical rationalist and an admirer of Karl Popper. Their letters later were published. In 1963 Albert finally got the chair of 'Social Sciences and General Studies of Methods' (later dubbed 'Sociology and Studies of Economics') at the Wirtschaftshochschule Mannheim (later University of Mannheim).

1961&ndash;1969 was the time of the so-called 'Positivismusstreit' ([[positivism dispute]]), i.e. the debate between Karl Popper and [[Theodor W. Adorno]] concerning [[positivism]] within German [[sociology]] during the 1960s. Albert participated at this meanwhile famous ''Conference of the German Society of Sociology'' ('Tagung der deutschen Gesellschaft für Soziologie') 1961 in Tübingen. In the beginning there was no dispute on [[positivism]], because Adorno as well as Popper were opposed to positivism. The debate was more about the differences between [[social sciences]] and [[natural sciences]] and the status of values in the social sciences. 1963 The debate was continued by [[Jürgen Habermas]] in the ''Festschrift für Adorno''. 1964 On the ''Soziologentag'' (conference on sociology) in Heidelberg the debate grew up into an excited discussion between Habermas and Albert. The famous dispute culminated in a collection of essays published in 1969, translated into several languages, also into English (1976, see booklist below). This dispute gained a broad audience.

In 1989 Hans Albert retired from active service as [[Professor Emeritus]] but continued writing books and giving lectures at many universities, such as the 1990 lectures at the University of Graz on Critical Rationalism, the 1995 'Walter Adolf Lectures' at the Hochschule St. Gallen, and the 1998 Wittgenstein-Lectures at the University of Bayreuth (with Prof. Rainer Hegselmann) about Critical Rationalism.

He was honored with the 'Vits prize' 1976 and with the 'Arthur Burckhard prize' 1984. He was decorated with the Austrian 'Ehrenkreuz für Kunst und Wissenschaft der Republik Österreich' (1994) and got honorary doctorates of the universities of [[Linz]]/Austria (1995), [[Athens]]/Greece (1997), [[Kassel]]/Germany (2000), [[Graz]]/Austria (2006), and [[Klagenfurt]]/Austria (2007).
