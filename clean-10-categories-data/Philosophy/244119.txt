'''Androcentrism''' ([[Ancient Greek]], ἀνήρ, "man, male"<ref name="Liddell & Scott">{{cite book | last1 = Liddell | first1 = Henry G. | last2 = Scott | first2 = Robert | last3 = Stuart Jones | first3 = Henry | others = Roderick McKenzie | author-link1 = Edward Liddell | author-link2 = Robert Scott (philologist) | author-link3 = Henry Stuart Jones | title = A Greek–English Lexicon | publisher = Clarendon Press | location = Oxford | year = 1940 | oclc = 499596825 | title-link = A Greek–English Lexicon }}</ref>) is the practice, conscious or otherwise, of placing a [[masculine]] point of view at the center of one's [[world view]], culture, and history, thereby culturally marginalizing [[femininity]]. The related adjective is ''androcentric'', while the practice of placing the [[feminine]] point of view at the center is ''[[gynocentric]]''.

== Origin of the term ==

The term ''androcentrism'' was introduced as an analytic concept by [[Charlotte Perkins Gilman]] in a scientific debate. Perkins Gilman described androcentric practices in society and the resulting problems they created in her investigation on ''The Man-Made World; or, Our Androcentric Culture'', published in 1911.<ref name="CPG_1911">{{cite book | last = Perkins Gilman | first = Charlotte | author-link = Charlotte Perkins Gilman | title = The man-made world: or, Our androcentric culture | publisher = Charlton | location = New York | year = 1911 | url = http://www.gutenberg.org/files/3015/3015-h/3015-h.htm | oclc = 988836210}}</ref> Because of this androcentrism can be understood as a societal fixation on masculinity whereby all things originate. Under androcentrism, masculinity is normative and all things outside of masculinity are defined as ''[[Other (philosophy)|other]]''. According to Perkins Gilman, masculine patterns of life and masculine mindsets claimed [[Universality (philosophy)|universality]] while female patterns were considered as [[deviance (sociology)|deviance]].<ref name="CPG_1911" />

== Education ==
Some universities such as the [[University of Oxford]] consciously practiced a [[numerus clausus]] and restricted the number of female undergraduates they accepted.<ref>{{cite web|author=Frances Lannon|url=http://www.timeshighereducation.co.uk/404111.article|title=Her Oxford|work=Times Higher Education|date=30 October 2008}}</ref>

== Literature ==
Research by Dr. David Anderson and Dr. Mykol Hamilton has documented the under-representation of female characters in 200 top-selling children's books from 2001 and a seven-year sample of [[Caldecott]] award-winning books.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Hamilton | first1 = Mykol C. | last2 = Anderson | first2 = David | last3 = Broaddus | first3 = Michelle | last4 = Young | first4 = Kate | title = Gender stereotyping and under-representation of female characters in 200 popular children's picture books: a twenty-first century update | journal = [[Sex Roles (journal)|Sex Roles]] | volume = 55 | issue = 11&ndash;12 | pages = 757&ndash;765 | doi = 10.1007/s11199-006-9128-6 | date = December 2006 | s2cid = 146234748 | ref = harv }}</ref> There were nearly twice as many male main characters as female main characters, and male characters appeared in illustrations 53 percent more than female characters. Most of the plot-lines centered on the male characters and their experiences of life.

== The arts ==

In 1985 a group of female artists from New York, the [[Guerrilla Girls]], began to protest the under-representation of female artists. According to them, male artists and the male viewpoint continued to dominate the visual art world. In a 1989 poster (displayed on NYC buses) titled "Do women have to be naked to get into the Met. Museum?" They reported that less than 5% of the artists in the Modern Art sections of the Met Museum were women, but 85% of the nudes were female.<ref>{{cite book | title = Guerilla Girls poster 1989 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20131125204514/http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml | archive-date = 25 November 2013 | url = http://www.guerrillagirls.com/posters/getnaked.shtml | publisher = [[Guerrilla Girls]] | access-date = 17 March 2011}}</ref>

Over 20 years later, women were still under-represented in the art world. In 2007, Jerry Saltz (journalist from the New York Times) criticized the Museum of Modern Art for undervaluing work by female artists. Of the 400 works of art he counted in the Museum of Modern Art, only 14 were by women (3.5%).<ref>{{cite news | last = Saltz | first = Jerry | author-link = Jerry Saltz | title = Where are All the Women?

== Generic male language ==
{{See also|Gender-neutral language}}
In literature, the use of masculine language to refer to men, women, intersex, and non-binary may indicate a male or androcentic bias in society where men are seen as the 'norm', and women, intersex, and non-binary are seen as the 'other'. Philosophy scholar [[Jennifer Saul]] argued that the use of male generic language marginalizes women, intersex, and non-binary in society.<ref>{{cite web | last = Saul | first = Jennifer | title = Feminist philosophy of language | url = http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/feminism-language/#1.1 | website = plato.stanford.edu | publisher = Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (online) | date = 2004 | access-date = 17 March 2011}}</ref> In recent years, some writers have started to use more gender-inclusive language (for instance, using the pronouns they/them, and using gender-inclusive words like humankind, person, partner, spouse, businessperson, fire-fighter, chairperson and police-officer).

Many studies have shown that male generic language is not interpreted as truly 'gender-inclusive.'<ref>

Three studies by Mykol Hamilton show that there is not only a male → people bias but also a people → male bias.<ref>{{cite journal | last = Hamilton | first = Mykol C. | title = <nowiki>Masculine bias in the attribution of personhood: people = male, male = people</nowiki> | journal = [[Psychology of Women Quarterly]] | volume = 15 | issue = 3 | pages = 393&ndash;402 | doi = 10.1111/j.1471-6402.1991.tb00415.x | date = November 1991 | s2cid = 143533483 | ref = harv }}</ref> In other words, a masculine bias remains even when people are exposed to only gender neutral language (although the bias is lessened). In two of her studies, half of the participants (after exposure to gender neutral language) had male-biased imagery but the rest of the participants displayed no gender bias at all.  In her third study, only males showed a masculine-bias (after exposure to gender neutral language) – females showed no gender bias. Hamilton asserted that this may be due to the fact that males have grown up being able to think more easily than females of "any person" as generic "he," since "he" applies to them. Further, of the two options for neutral language, neutral language that explicitly names women (e.g., "he or she") reduces androcentrism more effectively than neutral language that makes no mention of gender whatsoever (e.g., "human").<ref>{{cite journal | last = Khosroshahi | first = Fatemeh | title = Penguins don't care, but women do: A social identity analysis of a Whorfian problem | journal = [[Language in Society]] | volume = 18 | issue = 4 | pages = 505&ndash;525 | doi = 10.1017/S0047404500013889 | date = December 1989 | ref = harv }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Bailey | first1 = April H. | last2 = LaFrance | first2 = Marianne | title = Who counts as human?

Feminist anthropologist Sally Slocum argues that there has been a longstanding male bias in anthropological thought as evidenced by terminology used when referring to society, culture and humankind. According to Slocum, "All too often the word 'man' is used in such an ambiguous fashion that it is impossible to decide whether it refers to males or just the human species in general, including both males and females."<ref>Slocum, Sally (2012) [1975], "[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=Kou0uQAACAAJ Woman the gatherer: male bias in anthropology]", in {{cite book | editor-last1 = McGee | editor-first1 = R.
