Dutch [[philosophy]] is a broad branch of philosophy that discusses the contributions of Dutch philosophers to the discourse of [[Western philosophy]] and [[Renaissance philosophy]]. The philosophy, as its own entity, arose in the 16th and 17th centuries through the philosophical studies of [[Desiderius Erasmus]] and [[Baruch Spinoza]]. The adoption of the humanistic perspective by Erasmus, despite his Christian background, and rational but theocentric perspective expounded by Spinoza, supported each of these philosopher's works.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Caspari|first=Fritz|date=1947|title=Erasmus on the Social Functions of Christian Humanism|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=8|issue=1|pages=78–106|doi=10.2307/2707442|issn=0022-5037|jstor=2707442}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Melamed|first=Yitzhak Y.|title=Spinoza's Anti-Humanism: An Outline|url=https://www.academia.edu/564768|journal=The Rationalists: Between Tradition and Innovation|language=en|pages=147–166}}</ref> In general, the philosophy revolved around acknowledging the reality of human self-determination and rational thought rather than focusing on traditional ideals of [[fatalism]] and [[virtue]] raised in [[Christianity]].<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.erasmus.org/index.cfm?itm_name=humanism-EN|title=Humanism- Erasmus Center for Early Modern Studies|website=www.erasmus.org|access-date=2019-05-05}}</ref> The roots of philosophical frameworks like the [[mind-body dualism]] and [[monism]] debate can also be traced to Dutch philosophy, which is attributed to 17th century philosopher [[René Descartes]]. Descartes was both a mathematician and philosopher during the [[Dutch Golden Age]], despite being from the [[Kingdom of France]].<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Mehta|first=Neeta|date=2011|title=Mind-body Dualism: A critique from a Health Perspective|journal=Mens Sana Monographs|volume=9|issue=1|pages=202–209|doi=10.4103/0973-1229.77436|issn=0973-1229|pmc=3115289|pmid=21694971}}</ref> Modern Dutch philosophers like [[D.H.

In general, Dutch philosophy is characterised by a discussion of the importance of rational thought and [[humanism]] with literary links to religion, specifically [[Calvinism]] and biblical criticism thereof. Modern Dutch philosophers in the 20th century like [[Gerrit Mannoury]] have also, in addition to discussions on humanism, placed an emphasis on the connection between science and Dutch philosophy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=van Dantzig|first=D.|date=1956-01-01|title=Mannoury's impact on philosophy and significs|journal=Synthese|language=en|volume=10|issue=1|pages=423–431|doi=10.1007/BF00484684|s2cid=46958067|issn=1573-0964}}</ref>

Desiderius Erasmus's influence on Dutch philosophy is marked by his contributions to the discourse of [[Christian humanism]], which highlights a philosophy that synthesises the humanistic perspective of self-determination with classical Christian traditions of virtue.<ref name=":2">{{Citation|last=Rummel|first=Erika|title=Desiderius Erasmus|date=2017|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2017/entries/erasmus/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2017|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-05-06}}</ref> At the core of his philosophical teachings, Erasmus promulgated the religious doctrine of ''docta pietas'' (English: learned piety), which Erasmus believed was the 'Philosophy of Christ'.<ref name=":2" /> Erasmus, further expanded upon this notion in [[Julius Excluded from Heaven]] (Latin: ''Julius exclusus e coelis''), as cited in ''The Erasmus Reader'' where:

===Thought of Baruch Spinoza===
[[File:Spinoza.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Baruch de Spinoza]], c.1665.]]
The development of Dutch philosophy was one that expounded the fallacy behind God's metaphysical nature and in general, God's existence.

[[Ethics (Spinoza)]]-published after his death- garnered Spinoza scholarly attention, as he was one of the first Dutch philosophers during the Renaissance period that gave criticism to long-standing perspectives on God, the universe, nature and the ethical principles that grounded them.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Seidel|first=Esther|date=2001|title=SPINOZA|journal=European Judaism: A Journal for the New Europe|volume=34|issue=1|pages=57–69|issn=0014-3006|jstor=41443516}}</ref> Spinoza incorporated metaphysical and anthropological conceptions to support his conclusions.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=De Dijn|first=Herman|date=1986|title=Conceptions of Philosophical Method in Spinoza: Logica and Mos Geometricus|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|volume=40|issue=1|pages=55–78|issn=0034-6632|jstor=20128418}}</ref> This work, together with others, led to Spinoza being ostracised from the Jewish community in Amsterdam because he devalued the commonly held belief that God should not be "feign a God, like man, consisting of a body and mind, and subject to passions."<ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9vZLB8dhIIC&q=feign+a+God,+like+man,+consisting+of+a+body+and+mind+ethics&pg=PA538|title=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy in Early Modern Europe|last1=Clarke|first1=Desmond M.|last2=Wilson|first2=Catherine|date=2011-01-27|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199556137|language=en}}</ref>

Spinoza further extended this belief in his Propositions in ''Ethics'' by commenting on the nature of human desire as one that is interrelated with the mind's ''pathema (''Ancient Greek: passions).<ref>{{Citation|last=LeBuffe|first=Michael|title=Spinoza's Psychological Theory|date=2015|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2015/entries/spinoza-psychological/|encyclopedia=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2015|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref> In conjunction, the human desire and ''pathema'' contributed to what Spinoza argued was an [[affect (philosophy)]] of the human body, which grant humans the capability to achieve some state of perfection.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/emotions-17th18th/LD5Spinoza.html|title=17th and 18th Century Theories of Emotions > Spinoza on the Emotions (Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy)|website=plato.stanford.edu|access-date=2019-05-27}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|title=Affects, Actions and Passions in Spinoza: The Unity of Body and Mind|last1=Jaquet|first1=Chantal|last2=Reznichenko|first2=Tatiana|date=2018|publisher=Edinburgh University Press|isbn=9781474433181|editor-last=Del Lucchese|editor-first=Filippo|doi=10.3366/j.ctv7n09xx.5#metadata_info_tab_contents|jstor=10.3366/j.ctv7n09xx|doi-broken-date=2020-12-13}}</ref> Modern Dutch philosopher Theo Verbeek further comments that Spinoza's commentaries on the affect, in addition to the practice of libertas philosophandi, contributed to Renaissance Dutch philosophy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Rosenthal|first=Michael A.|date=2007-04-24|title=Spinoza's Theologico-Political Treatise: Exploring 'The Will of God' (review)|journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy|language=en|volume=45|issue=2|pages=334–335|doi=10.1353/hph.2007.0046|s2cid=145089633|issn=1538-4586}}</ref>

[[File:Descartes diagram.png|thumb|Descartes's diagram on the complexities underlying the function of [[mind-body dualism]].|208x208px]]
The dualism and monism philosophical frameworks are a dimension of the [[philosophy of mind]] with their roots traced to Dutch philosophy. René Descartes described the dualism framework as one that makes a distinction between the two primary substances constituting human beings: the mind (soul) and body.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Gorham|first=Geoffrey|date=1994|title=Mind-Body Dualism and the Harvey-Descartes Controversy|journal=Journal of the History of Ideas|volume=55|issue=2|pages=211–234|doi=10.2307/2709897|issn=0022-5037|jstor=2709897|pmid=11639919}}</ref> Similarly, D.H.Th. Vollenhoven further expanded upon this notion through his explanation of anthropological dualism, which focuses on gauging from what exact sources do the mind and body originate from.<ref name="Friesen 2005 102–132"/> On the contrary, the monism framework argues that all substances originate from one source where Descartes extended this through Cartesian dualism. He stated that a core attribute is that they are created by God or rather require some "immediate concurrence in all things."<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Clatterbaugh|first=Kenneth|date=1995|title=Cartesian Causality, Explanation, and Divine Concurrence|journal=History of Philosophy Quarterly|volume=12|issue=2|pages=195–207|issn=0740-0675|jstor=27744659}}</ref>

Spinoza's philosophy on the dualism was antithetical to Descartes, as he argued that instead of the mind and body being classed as substances that are distinct from one another, they are meant to be classified as one whole entity and are thus, interdependent on each other's functioning.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Spinoza on Mind, Body, and Numerical Identity|last=Morrison|first=John|publisher=Columbia University Press|year=2018|location=New York City|pages=1–5}}</ref> Portuguese-American neuroscientist [[Antonio Damasio]] supports Spinoza's idea by making a connection between the mind and body that one does not exist without the other and therefore, require to co-exist.<ref name=":3" /> He further comments how these philosophical commentaries contributed to Spinoza's influence on Dutch philosophy.<ref name=":3">{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=jsS5s81YtwEC&q=%22The+mind+exists+for+the+body,+is+engaged+in+telling+the+story+of+the+body's+multifarious+events,+and+uses+that+story+to+optimize+the+life+of+the+organism.%22&pg=PA206|title=Looking for Spinoza: Joy, Sorrow, and the Feeling Brain|last=Damasio|first=Antonio R.|date=2004|publisher=Vintage|isbn=9780099421832|language=en}}</ref> Spinoza also posited in ''Ethics'' that the only one extended substance in existence is the entire world, which consists of every form of matter in existence.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=DE DIJN|first=HERMAN|date=2013|journal=The Review of Metaphysics|volume=66|issue=3|pages=545–564|issn=0034-6632|jstor=23597943|title=Spinoza on Truth, Religion, and Salvation}}</ref> Spinoza considered human beings to be a subset of this one substance and are considered as an "extension" of the body.<ref>{{Cite journal|url=https://www.pdcnet.org/pdc/bvdb.nsf/purchase?openform&fp=monist&id=monist_1971_0055_0004_0579_0601|title=The Body Identical With the Human Mind: A Problem in Spinoza's Philosophy|last=Odegard|first=Douglas|date=1971-11-01|website=The Monist|access-date=2019-05-26|doi=10.5840/monist197155428|volume=55|pages=579–601}}</ref> A degree of mutual understanding among the two philosophers on this debate is found in their commentaries on the primary attribute of the mind and the body-the former being thought, while the latter, being extension.<ref name=":6">{{Cite journal|last=Long|first=Christopher P.|date=2001|title=The Rhetoric of the Geometrical Method: Spinoza's Double Strategy|journal=Philosophy & Rhetoric|volume=34|issue=4|pages=292–307|issn=0031-8213|jstor=40238099|doi=10.1353/par.2001.0019|s2cid=53555959}}</ref> The commonality in understanding lies in Descartes's discussion of each attribute exhibiting the "nature and essence" of all substances in [[Principia Philosophiae]], where Spinoza similarly argued in ''Ethics'' that the core property of the one substance is that it too constitutes some form of essence'''.'''<ref name=":6" /><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=U9vZLB8dhIIC&q=To+each+substance+there+belongs+one+principle+attribute;+in+the+case+of+mind,+this+is+thought,+and+in+the+case+of+body+it+is+extension.+A+substance+may+indeed+be+known+through+any+attribute+at+all;+but+each+substance+has+one+principle+property+which+constitutes+its+nature+and+essence,+and+to+which+all+its+proper-+ties+are+ref&pg=PA15|title=The Oxford Handbook of Philosophy in Early Modern Europe|last1=Clarke|first1=Desmond M.|last2=Wilson|first2=Catherine|date=2011-01-27|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=9780199556137|language=en}}</ref>

A particular attribute of this rationalistic philosophy that can be traced to Descartes's works is the concept of 'transparency of the mind' to which American philosopher [[Gary Hatfield]] states that the mind does not have any correlation with the material world, as it is subject to constant perception and [[indirect realism]].<ref name=":7">{{Citation|last=Hatfield|first=Gary|title=Transparency of Mind: The Contributions of Descartes, Leibniz, and Berkeley to the Genesis of the Modern Subject|date=2011|url=https://philpapers.org/rec/HATTOM|work=Departure for Modern Europe: A Handbook of Early Modern Philosophy (1400-1700)|pages=361–375|editor-last=Busche|editor-first=Hubertus|publisher=Felix Meiner Verlag|access-date=2019-05-26}}</ref> This extends to Hatfield further arguing that Descartes acknowledged in his understanding of rationalistic philosophy that a core condition of this concept is that if the mind is conscious, it is ultimately aware of its own thoughts and mental states.<ref name=":7" /> The distribution of these commentaries on rationalism by Descartes throughout the Renaissance period is credited to the studies of philosophy undertaken in [[Utrecht University]] and [[Leiden University]] in the Dutch Republic during the 17th century.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Nadler|first=Steven M.|date=1994|title=Descartes and the Dutch: Early Reactions to Cartesian Philosophy, 1637-1650 (review)|journal=Journal of the History of Philosophy|language=en|volume=32|issue=4|pages=672–673|doi=10.1353/hph.1994.0077|s2cid=145587235|issn=1538-4586}}</ref>

Signifist thinkers placed an emphasis on establishing a distinction between intuitionistic logic and [[linguistics]] of [[mathematics]], where the latter, according to Dutch mathematician Johan de Iongh, should guide any discussion of 'mathematical activities' in Dutch scientific philosophy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Iongh|first=J.

The education of Beth, who completed his PhD at [[University of Amsterdam]] in 1935 on natural sciences, was supported by the Marburg School's ideas of [[neo-Kantianism]].<ref name=":8" /> This school of thought commented on the need for a distinction between psychology and philosophy, whereas other signifist thinkers like Mannoury argued that the two academic fields should complement each other in discussions of science in Dutch philosophy.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Barth|first=Else|date=1998–1999|title=Beth's philosophical intentions.

This is because, according to Beth, intuitionistic logic acts as a foundational component of scientific discussions in Dutch philosophy.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://iuhpst.org/|title=The Birth Pangs of DLMPS|last=van Ulsen|first=Paul|date=2016-01-14|archive-url=http://iuhpst.org/pages/history.php|archive-date=2016-01-14|access-date=2019-05-28}}</ref><ref>{{Cite journal|last=Dieks|first=Dennis|date=2011|title=E.
