'''''Serial Experiments Lain''''' (stylized as '''''serial experiments lain''''') is a 1998 Japanese [[experimental cinema|experimental]] [[anime]] television series produced by [[Yasuyuki Ueda]] and animated by [[Triangle Staff]]. It was directed by [[Ryūtarō Nakamura]] and written by [[Chiaki J. Konaka]], with original character designs by [[Yoshitoshi ABe]]. The series' 13 episodes were originally broadcast on [[TV Tokyo]] from July to September 1998, and explore themes such as [[reality]], [[Identity (social science)|identity]] and [[communication]]<ref name="laineva">{{cite journal|last=Napier|first=Susan J.|author-link=Susan J.

== Plot ==
The series focuses on Lain Iwakura, an [[adolescent]] [[middle school]] girl living in suburban Japan, and her introduction to the Wired, a global [[computer network|communications network]] which is similar to the Internet. Lain lives with her middle-class family, which consists of her inexpressive older sister Mika, her emotionally distant mother, and her computer-obsessed father; Lain herself is somewhat awkward, introverted, and socially isolated from most of her school peers. However, the status-quo of her life becomes upturned by a series of bizarre incidents that start to take place after she learns that girls from her school have received an e-mail from a dead student, Chisa Yomoda, and she pulls out her old computer in order to check for the same message. Lain finds Chisa telling her that she is not dead, but has merely "abandoned her physical body and flesh" and is alive deep within the virtual reality-world of the Wired itself, where she has found the almighty and divine "[[God]]". From this point, Lain is caught up in a series of cryptic and surreal events that see her delving deeper into the mystery of the network in a narrative that explores themes of consciousness, perception, and the nature of reality.

"The Wired" is a [[Virtual world|virtual reality-world]] that contains and supports the very sum of ''all'' human communication and [[Telecommunications network|networks]], created with the [[telegraph]], [[televisions]], and [[telephone]] services, and expanded with the [[Internet]], [[cyberspace]], and subsequent networks. The series assumes that the Wired could be linked to a system that enables unconscious communication between people and machines without physical interface. The storyline introduces such a system with the [[Schumann resonances]], a property of the Earth's magnetic field that theoretically allows for unhindered long-distance communications. If such a link were created, the network would become equivalent to Reality as the general [[consensus reality|consensus]] of all perceptions and knowledge. The increasingly thin invisible line between what is real and what is virtual/digital begins to slowly shatter.

Masami Eiri is introduced as the project director on Protocol Seven (the next-generation Internet protocol in the series' time-frame) for major computer company Tachibana General Laboratories. He had secretly included [[computer programming|code]] of his very own creation to give himself absolute control of the Wired through the wireless system described above. He then "uploaded" his own [[brain]], [[conscience]], [[consciousness]], memory, feelings, emotions – his very self – into the Wired and "died" a few days after, leaving only his physical, living body behind. These details are unveiled around the middle of the series, but this is the point where the story of ''Serial Experiments Lain'' begins. Masami later explains that Lain is the artifact by which the wall between the virtual and material worlds is to fall, and that he needs her to get to the Wired and "abandon the flesh", as he did, to achieve his plan. The series sees him trying to convince her through interventions, using the promise of [[unconditional love]], romantic seduction and charm, and even, when all else fails, threats and force.

In the meantime, the anime follows a complex game of hide-and-seek between the "[[Knights of the Lambda Calculus|Knights of the Eastern Calculus]]", hackers whom Masami claims are "believers that enable him to be a God in the Wired", and Tachibana General Laboratories, who try to regain control of Protocol Seven. In the end, the viewer sees Lain realizing, after much [[introspection]], that she has absolute control over everyone's mind and over reality itself. Her dialogue with different versions of herself shows how she feels shunned from the material world, and how she is afraid to live in the Wired, where she has the possibilities and responsibilities of an almighty goddess. The last scenes feature her erasing everything connected to herself from everyone's memories. She is last seen, unchanged, encountering her oldest and closest friend Alice once again, who is now married. Lain promises herself that she and Alice will surely meet again anytime as Lain can literally [[Omnipresence|go and be anywhere she desires between both worlds]].

== Characters ==
;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Lain Iwakura}}|岩倉 玲音|Iwakura Rein}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Kaori Shimizu (voice actress)|Kaori Shimizu]]|[[Bridget Hoffman|Ruby Marlowe]]}}
:The titular character of the series. Lain is a fourteen-year-old girl who uncovers her true nature through the series. She is first depicted as a shy [[Middle school|junior high school]] student with few friends or interests. She later grows multiple bolder personalities, both in the physical world and the Wired, and starts making more friends. As the series progresses, she eventually comes to discover that she is, in reality, merely an [[Autonomy|autonomous]], [[Sentience|sentient]] [[computer program]] in the physical and corporeal form of a human being, designed to sever the invisible barrier between the Wired and the real world. In the end, Lain is challenged to accept herself as a ''de facto'' [[goddess]] for the Wired, having become an [[Omnipotence|omnipotent]] and [[Omnipresence|omnipresent]] virtual being with worshippers of her own, as well as an ability to exist beyond the borders of devices, time, or space.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Masami Eiri}}|英利 政美|Eiri Masami}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Shō Hayami]]|[[Kirk Thornton|Sparky Thornton]]}}
: The key designer of Protocol Seven. While working for Tachibana General Laboratories, he illicitly included codes enabling him to control the whole protocol at will and embedded his own mind and will into the seventh protocol. Because of this, he was fired by Tachibana General Laboratories, and was found dead not long after. He believes that the only way for humans to evolve even further and develop even greater abilities is to absolve themselves of their physical and human limitations, and to live as virtual entities—or [[Avatar (computing)|avatars]]—in the Wired for eternity. He claims to have been Lain's creator all along, but was in truth standing in for another, who was waiting for the Wired to reach its more evolved current state.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Yasuo Iwakura}}|岩倉 康男|Iwakura Yasuo}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Ryūsuke Ōbayashi]]|[[Barry Stigler|Gil Starberry]]}}
:Lain's father. Passionate about computers and electronic communication, he works with Masami Eiri at Tachibana General Laboratories. He subtly pushes Lain, his "youngest daughter", towards the Wired and monitors her development until she becomes more and more aware of herself and of her ''raison d'être''. He eventually leaves Lain, telling her that although he did not enjoy playing house, he genuinely loved and cared for her as a real father would. Despite Yasuo's eagerness to lure Lain into the Wired, he warns her not to get overly involved in it or to confuse it with the real world.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Miho Iwakura}}|岩倉 美穂|Iwakura Miho}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Rei Igarashi]]|[[Petrea Burchard|Celeste Burch]]}}
:Lain's mother. Although she dotes on Mika, she is indifferent towards Lain. Like her husband, she ends up leaving Lain.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Alice Mizuki}}|瑞城 ありす|Mizuki Arisu}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Yōko Asada]]|[[Emilie Brown|Emily Brown]]}}
:Lain's classmate and only true friend throughout the series. She is very sincere and has no discernable quirks. She is the first to attempt to help Lain socialize; she takes her out to a nightclub. From then on, she tries her best to look after Lain. Alice, along with her two best friends Julie and Reika, were taken by Chiaki Konaka from his previous work, ''Alice in Cyberland''.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Mika Iwakura}}|岩倉 美香|Iwakura Mika}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Ayako Kawasumi]]|[[Patricia Ja Lee]]}}
:Lain's older sister, an apathetic sixteen-year-old high school student. She seems to enjoy mocking Lain's behavior and interests. Mika is considered by ''Anime Revolution'' to be the only normal member of Lain's family:<ref>{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070323032932/http://www.anime-revolution.com/anime/sel-character-profiles |archive-date=March 23, 2007|url=http://www.anime-revolution.com/anime/sel-character-profiles|title=[SEL] Character Profiles|work=Anime Revolution|access-date=December 30, 2006}}</ref> she sees her boyfriend in [[love hotel]]s, is on a diet, and shops in [[Shibuya, Tokyo|Shibuya]]. At a certain point in the series, she becomes heavily traumatized by violent hallucinations; while Lain begins freely delving into the Wired, Mika is taken there by her proximity to Lain, and she gets stuck between the real world and the Wired.<ref name="otakon">{{cite web |url=http://www.cjas.org/~leng/o2klain.htm |title=Otakon Lain Panel Discussion with Yasuyuki Ueda and Yoshitoshi ABe |access-date=September 16, 2006 |date=August 5, 2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061026065237/http://www.cjas.org/~leng/o2klain.htm |archive-date=2006-10-26 |url-status=live }}</ref>

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Taro}}|タロウ|Tarō}}
:{{Voiced by|Keito Takimoto|[[Brianne Siddall|Ian Hawk]]}}
:A young boy of about Lain's age. He occasionally works for the Knights to bring forth "the one truth". Despite this, he has not yet been made a member, and knows nothing of their true intentions. Taro loves [[Virtual reality|VR]] games and hangs out all day at Cyberia  with his friends, Myu-Myu and Masayuki. He uses special technology, such as custom Handi Navi and video goggles. Taro takes pride in his internet anonymity, and he asks Lain for a date with her Wired self in exchange for information.

;{{visible anchor|Office Worker}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Shigeru Chiba]]|Richard Plantagenet}}
:A top executive from Tachibana General Laboratories. He has a personal agenda, which he carries out with the help of the Men in Black. He looks forward to the arrival of a real God through the Wired, and is the man behind the Knights' mass assassination. There are many things he doesn't know about Lain, but he'd rather ask questions about her than disclose his agenda.

:Lin Suixi ({{zh|c=林随錫|p=Lín Suíxī}}), {{voiced by|[[Takumi Yamazaki]]|[[Bob Buchholz|Robert Wicks]]}}
:The Men in Black work for the above "Office Worker" in tracking down and murdering all of the members of the Knights. They are not told the true plan, but they know that Masami Eiri is somehow involved, despite having been "killed." They see no need for an almighty, all-powerful God—let alone Lain—in the Wired.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Chisa Yomoda}}|四方田 千砂|Yomoda Chisa}}
:{{Voiced by|Sumi Mutoh|[[Lia Sargent]]}}
:A teenage girl who committed suicide at the beginning of the series. After her death, she e-mails Lain, Julie, and a few other kids, saying that she's still alive in the Wired.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Reika Yamamoto}}|山本 麗華|Yamamoto Reika}}
:{{Voiced by|[[Chiharu Tezuka]]|[[Lenore Zann]]}} 
:One of Alice's friends from school. She doesn't seem to care for Lain, since she harasses her quite a lot. She's more serious than Julie, and also somewhat meaner.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Julie Kato}}|加藤 樹莉|Katō Juri}}
:{{Voiced by|Manabi Mizuno|Alexis A. Edwards}}
:Another friend of Alice. She also harasses Lain, but not as severely as Reika does. She is sometimes insensitive to other people's feelings.

;{{nihongo|{{visible anchor|Masayuki}}|マサユキ}}
:{{Voiced by|Sora Fujima|}}
:Taro's best friend. He is usually seen hanging out with Taro and Myu-Myu.

== Production ==
''Serial Experiments Lain'' was conceived, as a series, to be original to the point of it being considered "an enormous risk" by its producer Yasuyuki Ueda.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animeland.com/index.php?rub=articles&id=399|work=AnimeLand|publisher=Anime Manga Presse|title=Abe Yoshitoshi et Ueda Yasuyuki|last=Scipion|first=Johan|access-date=September 16, 2006|language=fr|date=2003-03-01|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927120258/http://www.animeland.com/index.php?rub=articles&id=399|archive-date=2007-09-27|url-status=live}}</ref>

Producer Ueda had to answer repeated queries about a statement made in an ''[[Animerica]]'' interview.<ref name="otakon"/><ref name="chat">{{cite web|url=http://www.cjas.org/~leng/lainchat.htm|author=The Anime Colony|title=Online Lain Chat with Yasuyuki Ueda and Yoshitoshi ABe|access-date=September 16, 2006|date=August 7, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024122218/http://www.cjas.org/~leng/lainchat.htm|archive-date=2006-10-24|url-status=live}}<!--Note: The moderated part is also available here: http://www.scifi.com/transcripts/2000/animemonday.html--></ref><ref name="Ueda">{{cite web|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804105225/http://www.animejump.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=32&page=1 |archive-date=2008-08-04|url=http://www.animejump.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=32&page=1|title=Anime Jump!: Lain Men:Yasuyuki Ueda|access-date=September 26, 2006}}</ref> The controversial statement said ''Lain'' was "a sort of cultural war against American culture and the American sense of values we <nowiki>[Japan]</nowiki> adopted after [[World War II]]".<ref name="Animerica">''[[Animerica]]'', (Vol. 7 No. 9, p. 29)</ref> He later explained in numerous interviews that he created ''Lain'' with a set of values he took as distinctly Japanese; he hoped Americans would not understand the series as the Japanese would. This would lead to a "war of ideas" over the meaning of the anime, hopefully culminating in new communication between the two cultures. When he discovered that the American audience held the same views on the series as the Japanese, he was disappointed.<ref name="Ueda"/>

The ''Lain'' franchise was originally conceived to connect across forms of media (anime, video games, manga). Producer [[Yasuyuki Ueda]] said in an interview, "the approach I took for this project was to communicate the essence of the work by the total sum of many media products". The scenario for the video game was written first, and the video game was produced at the same time as the anime series, though the series was released first. A [[dōjinshi]] titled "The Nightmare of Fabrication" was produced by Yoshitoshi ABe and released in Japanese in the artbook ''Omnipresence in the Wired''. Ueda and Konaka declared in an interview that the idea of a multimedia project was not unusual in Japan, as opposed to the contents of ''Lain'', and the way they are exposed.<ref name="Animerica2"/>

=== Writing ===
The authors were asked in interviews if they had been influenced by ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'', in the themes and graphic design. This was strictly denied by writer [[Chiaki J. Konaka]] in an interview, arguing that he had not seen ''Evangelion'' until he finished the fourth episode of ''Lain''. Being primarily a horror movie writer, his stated influences are [[Jean-Luc Godard|Godard]] (especially for using typography on screen), ''[[The Exorcist (film)|The Exorcist]]'', ''Hell House'', and [[Dan Curtis]]'s ''[[House of Dark Shadows]]''. Alice's name, like the names of her two friends Julie and Reika, came from a previous production from Konaka, ''Alice in Cyberland'', which in turn was largely influenced by ''[[Alice in Wonderland]]''. As the series developed, Konaka was "surprised" by how close Alice's character became to the original ''Wonderland'' character.<ref name="HK">{{cite journal|date=April 2000|title=Serial Experiments Lain|journal=[[HK Magazine]]|issue=14|publisher=Asia City Publishing|location=Hong Kong}} in {{cite web|url=http://www.konaka.com/alice6/lain/hk.html|title=HK Interview|publisher=[[Chiaki J.

[[File:Lain hacker small.jpg|left|thumb|250px|alt=A young girl in a white shift sits with her back to us in the dark, focusing her attention on many glowing computer screens which surround her.|Lain's custom computer features holographic displays and liquid carbon dioxide cooling.]]

[[Vannevar Bush]] (and [[memex]]), [[John C. Lilly]], [[Timothy Leary]] and his [[eight-circuit model of consciousness]], [[Ted Nelson]] and [[Project Xanadu]] are cited as precursors to the Wired.<ref name="Animerica2">[[Animerica]], (Vol. 7 No. 9, p.28)</ref> [[Douglas Rushkoff]] and his book ''[[Cyberia (book)|Cyberia]]'' were originally to be cited as such,<ref name="otakon"/> and in ''Lain'' Cyberia became the name of a nightclub populated with hackers and techno-punk teenagers. Likewise, the series' ''[[deus ex machina]]'' lies in the conjunction of the [[Schumann resonances]] and [[Carl Jung|Jung]]'s [[collective unconscious]] (the authors chose this term over [[Kabbalah]] and [[Akashic records|Akashic Record]]).<ref name="Animerica"/> [[Majestic 12]] and the [[Roswell UFO incident]] are used as examples of how a hoax might still affect history, even after having been exposed as such, by creating sub-cultures.<ref name=Animerica/> This links again to Vannevar Bush, the alleged "brains" of MJ12. Two of the literary references in ''Lain'' are quoted through Lain's father: he first logs onto a website with the password "Think Bule Count One Tow" ("[[Think Blue, Count Two]]" is an [[Instrumentality of Mankind|Instrumentality of Man]] story featuring virtual persons projected as real ones in people's minds);<ref name="ep1">''Serial Experiments Lain'', "Layer 01: WEIRD"</ref> and his saying that "[[Madeleine (cake)|madeleines]] would be good with the tea" in the last episode makes ''Lain'' "perhaps the only cartoon to allude to [[Marcel Proust|Proust]]".<ref name="Gazette">{{cite web|url=http://www.movie-gazette.com/cinereviews/860 |title=Movie Gazette: "Serial Experiments Lain Volume : Reset" Review |access-date=October 11, 2006 |archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20060521165608/http://www.movie-gazette.com/cinereviews/860 |archive-date = May 21, 2006}}</ref><ref>'''Yasuo:''' "I will bring madeleines next time.

=== Character design ===
[[File:Lain Haircut.JPG|Right|thumb|250px|alt=A young girl in a white shift kneels facing us with scissors in her hand, and hanks of her own hair on the ground, leaving one forelock uncut. The background is blue.|ABe came up with Lain's hair by imagining Lain cutting it herself and making a ponytail of what was left.<ref name="chat"/> This was later included in his ''Omnipresence in the Wired'' artbook.<ref>{{cite book|last=ABe|first=Yoshitoshi|title=Omnipresence In The Wired|chapter=Hair cut 01-04|publisher=Pioneer LDC|language=ja|year=1998|isbn=978-4-7897-1343-6}}</ref>]]

[[Yoshitoshi ABe]] confesses to have never read manga as a child, as it was "off-limits" in his household.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://animejump.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=33&page=1 |title=Anime Jump!: Lain Men: Yoshitoshi ABe |access-date=September 16, 2006 |year=2000 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060510030644/http://www.animejump.com/modules.php?op=modload&name=Sections&file=index&req=viewarticle&artid=33&page=1 |archive-date=May 10, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref> His major influences are "nature and everything around him".<ref name="otakon"/> Specifically speaking about Lain's character, ABe was inspired by [[Kenji Tsuruta]], [[Akihiro Yamada]], [[Range Murata]] and [[Yukinobu Hoshino]].<ref name="chat"/> In a broader view, he has been influenced in his style and technique by Japanese artists Chinai-san and Tabuchi-san.<ref name="otakon"/>

The character design of Lain was not ABe's sole responsibility. Her distinctive left forelock for instance was a demand from Yasuyuki Ueda. The goal was to produce asymmetry to reflect Lain's unstable and disconcerting nature.<ref name="fruits">''FRUiTS Magazine'' No. 15, October 1998.</ref> It was designed as a mystical symbol, as it is supposed to prevent voices and spirits from being heard by the left ear.<ref name="chat"/> The bear pajamas she wears were a demand from [[character animation]] director Takahiro Kishida. Though bears are a trademark of the Konaka brothers, Chiaki Konaka first opposed the idea.<ref name="HK"/> Director Nakamura then explained how the bear motif could be used as a shield for confrontations with her family. It is a key element of the design of the shy "real world" Lain (see "mental illness" under [[#Themes|Themes]]).<ref name="HK"/> When she first goes to the Cyberia [[nightclub]], she wears a bear hat for similar reasons.<ref name="fruits"/> Retrospectively, Konaka said that Lain's pajamas became a major factor in drawing fans of ''[[Moe (slang)|moe]]'' characterization to the series, and remarked that "such items may also be important when making anime".<ref name="HK"/>

ABe's original design was generally more complicated than what finally appeared on screen. As an example, the X-shaped hairclip was to be an interlocking pattern of gold links. The links would open with a snap, or rotate around an axis until the moment the " X " became a " = ". This was not used as there is no scene where Lain takes her hairclip off.<ref name="MAX2">''Manga Max'' magazine, September 1999, p. 22, "Unreal to Real"</ref>

===Themes===
''Serial Experiments Lain'' is not a conventionally linear story, but "an alternative anime, with modern themes and realization".<ref>''Benkyo!'' Magazine, March 1999, p.16, "In My Humble Opinion"</ref> Themes range from theological to psychological and are dealt with in a number of ways: from classical dialogue to image-only introspection, passing by direct interrogation of imaginary characters.

[[Communication]], in its wider sense, is one of the main themes of the series,<ref name="THEM">{{cite web|url=http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=353|title=T.H.E.M.Anime Review of Serial Experiments Lain|access-date=November 24, 2006|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061011155649/http://www.themanime.org/viewreview.php?id=353|archive-date=2006-10-11|url-status=live}}</ref> not only as opposed to loneliness, but also as a subject in itself.

[[File:Lain Split Personnalities.JPG|left|thumb|250px|alt=A series of drawings depicting the different personalities of Lain—the first shows shy body language, the second shows bolder body language, and the third grins in an unhinged fashion.|The different personalities of Lain have their names written using different scripts.]]

[[Mental illness]], especially [[dissociative identity disorder]], is a significant theme in ''Lain'':<ref name="MAX2"/> the main character is constantly confronted with alter-egos, to the point where writer Chiaki Konaka and Lain's voice actress Kaori Shimizu had to agree on subdividing the character's dialogues between three different [[Orthography|orthographs]].<ref name="MAX2"/> The three names designate distinct "versions" of Lain: the real-world, "childish" Lain has a shy attitude and bear pajamas. The "advanced" Lain, her Wired personality, is bold and questioning. Finally, the "evil" Lain is sly and devious, and does everything she can to harm Lain or the ones close to her.<ref name="HK"/> As a writing convention, the authors spelled their respective names in [[kanji]], [[katakana]], and [[Romanization of Japanese|roman]] characters (see picture).<ref name="visual">{{cite book|last=ABe|first=Yoshitoshi|title=Visual Experiments Lain|year=1998|publisher=Triangle Staff/Pioneer LDC.|isbn=978-4-7897-1342-9}}, page 42</ref>

[[Reality]] never has the pretense of objectivity in ''Lain''.<ref name="MAX">''Manga Max'' Magazine, September 1999, p. 21, "God's Eye View"</ref> Acceptations of the term are battling throughout the series, such as the "natural" reality, defined through normal dialogue between individuals; the material reality; and the tyrannic reality, enforced by one person onto the minds of others.<ref name="DVDoutsider"/> A key debate to all interpretations of the series is to decide whether matter flows from thought, or the opposite.<ref name="DVDoutsider"/><ref>Serial Experiments Lain, Layer 06: KIDS: "your physical body exists only to confirm your existence".</ref> The production staff carefully avoided "the so-called God's Eye Viewpoint" to make clear the "limited field of vision" of the world of ''Lain''.<ref name=MAX/>

[[Theology]] plays its part in the development of the story too. ''Lain'' has been viewed as a questioning of the possibility of an infinite spirit in a finite body.<ref name="Univ">[https://web.archive.org/web/20060302194747/http://www.ahcca.unimelb.edu.au/refractory/journalissues/vol3/colman.htm Study on ''Lain'', ''Buffy'', and ''Attack of the clones''] by Felicity J.

===Apple computers===
''Lain'' contains extensive references to [[Apple Inc.|Apple]] computers, as the brand was used at the time by most of the creative staff, such as writers, producers, and the graphical team.<ref name="HK"/> As an example, the title at the beginning of each episode is announced by the Apple computer [[speech synthesis]] program  [[PlainTalk]], using the voice ''"Whisper"'', e.g. <code>say -v Whisper "Weird: Layer zero one"</code>. Tachibana Industries, the company that creates the NAVI computers, is a reference to Apple computers: "tachibana" means "Mandarin orange" in Japanese. NAVI is the abbreviation of [[Knowledge Navigator]], and the HandiNAVI is based on the [[Apple Newton]], one of the world's first [[Personal digital assistant|PDA]]s. The NAVIs are seen to run "Copland OS Enterprise" (this reference to [[Copland (operating system)|Copland]] was an initiative of [[Chiaki J. Konaka|Konaka]], a declared Apple fan),<ref name="HK"/> and Lain's and Alice's NAVIs closely resembles the [[Twentieth Anniversary Macintosh]] and the [[iMac]] respectively. The HandiNAVI programming language, as seen on the seventh episode, is a dialect of [[Lisp (programming language)|Lisp]]. Notice that the Newton also used a Lisp dialect ([[NewtonScript]]). The program being typed by Lain can be found in the [[Carnegie Mellon University|CMU]] [[Artificial intelligence|AI]] repository;<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/code/fun/life.cl|title=Conway's Game of Life|publisher=[[Carnegie Mellon University]]|access-date=2009-06-24|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090722175621/https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/project/ai-repository/ai/lang/lisp/code/fun/life.cl|archive-date=2009-07-22|url-status=live}}</ref> it is a simple implementation of [[Conway's Game of Life]] in [[Common Lisp]].

During a series of disconnected images, an iMac and the [[Think Different]] advertising slogan appears for a short time, while the ''Whisper'' voice says it.<ref name="INFORN">''Serial Experiments Lain'', Layer 11: INFORNOGRAPHY.</ref> This was an unsolicited insertion from the graphic team, also Mac-enthusiasts.<ref name="HK"/> Other subtle allusions can be found: "Close the world, Open the nExt" is the slogan for the ''Serial Experiments Lain'' video game. [[NeXT]] was the company that produced [[NeXTSTEP]], which later evolved into [[macOS|Mac OS X]] after Apple bought NeXT. Another example is "To Be Continued." at the end of episodes 1–12, with a blue "B" and a red "e" on "Be": ''this'' "Be" is the original logo of [[Be Inc.]], a company founded by ex-Apple employees and NeXT's main competitor in its time.<ref name="Be">{{cite web|url=http://www.beatjapan.org/mirror/www.be.com/ |title=Be, Inc. |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031128123907/http://www.beincorporated.com/ |archive-date=November 28, 2003 |access-date=November 27, 2006 |url-status=dead }}</ref>

The series' opening theme, "Duvet", was written and performed by Jasmine Rodgers and the British band [[Bôa]]. The ending theme, {{nihongo|"Distant Scream"|遠い叫び|Tōi Sakebi}}, was written and composed by [[Reichi Nakaido]].

The anime series was licensed in North America by [[NBCUniversal Entertainment Japan|Pioneer Entertainment]] (later Geneon USA) on [[VHS]], [[DVD]] and [[LaserDisc]] in 1999. However, the company closed its USA division in December 2007 and the series went out-of-print as a result.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-09-26/geneon-usa-to-cancel-dvd-sales-distribution-by-friday|title=Geneon USA To Cancel DVD Sales, Distribution By Friday|website=[[Anime News Network]]|date=September 26, 2007|access-date=January 30, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100328222859/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2007-09-26/geneon-usa-to-cancel-dvd-sales-distribution-by-friday|archive-date=2010-03-28|url-status=live}}</ref> However, at [[Anime Expo]] 2010, North American distributor [[Funimation]] announced that it had obtained the license to the series and re-released it in 2012.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-07-02/funi-adds-live-action-moyashimon|title=Funi Adds Live Action Moyashimon Live Action, More|website=[[Anime News Network]]|date=July 2, 2010|access-date=July 3, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100704090410/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/news/2010-07-02/funi-adds-live-action-moyashimon|archive-date=2010-07-04|url-status=live}}</ref> It was also released in [[Singapore]] by [[Odex]].

Lain searches for the reason behind the strange happenings and finds Professor Hodgeson, the creator of KIDS, an experiment that started fifteen years ago that tried to gather [[Parapsychology|psi]] energy from children and store it, though the result of the project destroyed the children. Now it seems that the Knights have gotten hold of the project's schematics. When the Men in Black return, Lain goes outside to see them.

It is reported that the Knights cracked the firewall of the information control center of the Wired. As the activity of the Knights begins to surface, the network is in search for Lain. The Men in Black ask Lain to follow them to an office in the Tachibana General Laboratories, where the [[Serial Experiments Lain#Office Worker|Office Worker]] in charge of the Men in Black, after her help of fixing his computer, shows Lain a projection of herself in the Wired taking out one of the members of the Knights. After the Office Worker deduces that Lain in the real world and in the Wired are one and the same, he questions her about her origins.

To cope with the distress of rejection, Lain acts directly on reality for the first time, finding out that she can "delete" the event of the rumors.

Lilly]], who conducted experiments with [[cetacean intelligence|dolphin communication]], pioneer [[Ted Nelson]], who founded [[Project Xanadu]], and the [[Schumann resonances]] are all mentioned, explaining how the human consciousness can be communicated through a network without the use of a device. 
It is also noted that a man named [[#Masami Eiri|Masami Eiri]] has suddenly committed suicide. During that time, Lain gets a computer microchip from J.J., the disc jockey from Cyberia. She then asks Taro on a "date" and takes him to her home, where she asks him about the microchip. After becoming frightened, he admits it is a computer code made to disrupt human memory, and it was made by the Knights. Although he defends them, he admits not knowing much about them.

Eiri is considered the God of the Wired because he explained that he is worshiped by the Knights. Knowing this, Lain deals with the Knights once and for all by leaking a list of all of its members onto the Wired, leaving a trail of murder by the Men in Black and suicide in its wake. Even with the Knights gone, Eiri still claims he is the God of the Wired, since he says that the real Lain exists in the Wired, not the real world.

Lain later appears to Alice in her room to make things right with her again concerning the false rumors.

After he leaves, both Men in Black suffer death from an image of Lain etched in their retinas. Alice enters Lain's eerie house and goes inside her room. Lain explains that she is actually a computerized program designed to destroy the barrier between the two worlds.
 Lain is still affixed on the fact that humans no longer need a physical body to stay alive, but Alice shows that her heartbeat proves otherwise. Suddenly, Eiri, first unseen to Alice, appears behind Lain, assuming she needs to be "debugged". Lain argues that Eiri was just an "acting god", for she is the true Goddess of the Wired. Eiri retaliates by transforming into a monstrous form to attain the vastly limitless power and strength that she possesses, but Lain manages to crush Eiri with her electrical equipment, wiping him out for good.

Distraught from doing so, Lain is determined to discover her true form and identity and takes radical action. She is confronted by her separate bolder self of the Wired, who reminds her that the Wired is not an upper layer of the real world. 
Her bolder Wired self then assures her that she is the true Goddess of the Wired, saying she is an omnipotent and omnipresent virtual being that can go and be anywhere she desires and merely watch the real world from afar. After causing her bolder self to disappear, Lain sees her father. Alice, now older with a spouse, spots Lain standing on an overpass, having some ''[[déjà vu]]'' about Lain but not recognizing who she is. Alice then says goodbye, saying that she might run into Lain someday.

===Soundtracks===
The first [[original soundtrack]], ''Serial Experiments Lain Soundtrack'', features music by [[Reichi Nakaido]]: the ending theme and part of the television series' score, alongside other songs inspired by the series. The second, ''Serial Experiments Lain Soundtrack: Cyberia Mix'', features [[electronica]] songs inspired by the television series, including a remix of the opening theme "Duvet" by DJ Wasei. The third, ''lain BOOTLEG'', consists of the ambient score of the series across forty-five tracks. ''BOOTLEG'' also contains a second mixed-mode data and audio disc, containing a clock program and a game, as well as an extended version of the first disc – nearly double the length – across 57 tracks in 128 kbit/s [[MP3]] format, and sound effects from the series in [[WAV]] format. Because the word ''[[Bootleg recording|bootleg]]'' appears in its title, it is easily confused with the Sonmay [[copyright infringement|counterfeit edition]] of itself, which only contains the first disc in an edited format. All three soundtrack albums were released by [[Pioneer Corporation|Pioneer Records]].

The series' opening theme, "[[Twilight (Bôa album)|Duvet]]", was written and performed in English by the British rock band [[Bôa]].

On November 26, 1998, Pioneer LDC released a video game with the same name as the anime for the [[PlayStation]].<ref>{{cite web|url=https://www.amazon.co.jp/dp/B00005OVPO/|title=Serial Experiments Lain|access-date=September 25, 2010}}</ref> It was designed by Konaka and Yasuyuki, and made to be a "network simulator" in which the player would navigate to explore Lain's story.<ref name="HK"/> The creators themselves did not call it a game, but "Psycho-Stretch-Ware",<ref name="HK"/> and it has been described as being a kind of [[graphic novel]]: the gameplay is limited to unlocking pieces of information, and then reading/viewing/listening to them, with little or no puzzle needed to unlock.<ref name="GAF">{{cite web|url=http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/review.php?reviewid=67 |title=Games Are Fun: "Review – Serial Experiments Lain – Japan" |date=2003-04-25 |access-date=2006-11-10 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927061706/http://www.gamesarefun.com/gamesdb/review.php?reviewid=67 |archive-date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref> Lain distances itself even more from classical games by the [[random]] order in which information is collected.<ref name="HK"/> The aim of the authors was to let the player get the feeling that there are myriads of informations that they would have to sort through, and that they would have to do with less than what exists to understand.<ref name="HK"/> As with the anime, the creative team's main goal was to let the player "feel" Lain, and "to understand her problems, and to love her".<ref name="Animerica2"/> A guidebook to the game called ''Serial Experiments Lain Official Guide'' ({{ISBN|4-07-310083-1}}) was released the same month by [[MediaWorks (publisher)|MediaWorks]].<ref>{{cite book|script-title=ja:シリアルエクスペリメンツレイン公式ガイド|trans-title=Serial Experiments Lain Official Guide|language=ja|id= {{ASIN|4073100831|country=jp}}}}</ref>

According to Christian Nutt from ''[[Newtype USA]]'', the main attraction to the series is its keen view on "the interlocking problems of identity and technology". Nutt saluted Abe's "crisp, clean character design" and the "perfect soundtrack" in his 2005 review of series, saying that "''Serial Experiments Lain'' might not yet be considered a true classic, but it's a fascinating evolutionary leap that helped change the future of anime."<ref name="newtype">{{cite journal|last=Nutt|first=Christian|date=January 2005|title=Serial Experiments Lain DVD Box Set: Lost in the Wired|journal=[[Newtype USA]]|volume=4|issue=1|page=179}}</ref> ''Anime Jump'' gave it 4.5/5,<ref name="AnimeJump"/> and Anime on DVD gave it A+ on all criteria for volume 1 and 2, and a mix of A and A+ for volume 3 and 4.<ref name="referencekatamari"/>
''Lain'' was subject to commentary in the literary and academic worlds. The ''Asian Horror Encyclopedia'' calls it "an outstanding psycho-horror anime about the psychic and spiritual influence of the Internet".<ref name="horror">{{cite book|last=Bush|first=Laurence C.|title=Asian Horror Encyclopedia|date=October 2001|publisher=Writers Club Press|isbn=978-0-595-20181-5}}, page 162.</ref> It notes that the red spots present in all the shadows look like blood pools (see picture). It notes the death of a girl in a train accident is "a source of much ghost lore in the twentieth century", more so in Tokyo.

The ''Anime Essentials'' anthology by [[Gilles Poitras]] describes it as a "complex and somehow existential" anime that "pushed the envelope" of anime diversity in the 1990s, alongside the much better known ''[[Neon Genesis Evangelion]]'' and ''[[Cowboy Bebop]]''.<ref name="essential">{{cite book|last=Poitras|first=Gilles|title=Anime Essentials|date=December 2001|publisher=Stone Bridge Press, LLC|isbn=978-1-880656-53-2 }}, page 28.</ref> Professor [[Susan J. Napier]], in her 2003 reading to the [[American Philosophical Society]] called ''The Problem of Existence in Japanese Animation'' (published 2005), compared ''Serial Experiments Lain'' to ''[[Ghost in the Shell]]'' and [[Hayao Miyazaki]]'s ''[[Spirited Away]]''.<ref name="Napier APS">{{cite journal|title=The Problem of Existence in Japanese Animation|first=Susan J., Dr.|last=Napier|author-link=Susan J. Napier|journal=Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society|volume=149|issue=1|date=March 2005|pages=72–79|jstor=4598910}}</ref> According to her, the main characters of the two other works cross barriers; they can cross back to our world, but Lain cannot. Napier asks whether there is something to which Lain should return, "between an empty 'real' and a dark 'virtual'".<ref>{{Harvard citation no brackets|Napier|2005|p=78}}</ref> Mike Toole of [[Anime News Network]] named ''Serial Experiments Lain'' as one of the most important anime of the 1990s.<ref>{{cite web|last1=Toole|first1=Mike|title=Evangel-a-like - The Mike Toole Show|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-mike-toole-show/2011-06-05|website=[[Anime News Network]]|access-date=20 November 2015|date=5 June 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151010114552/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/the-mike-toole-show/2011-06-05|archive-date=2015-10-10|url-status=live}}</ref>

Unlike the anime, the video game drew little attention from the public.<ref name="GAF"/> Criticized for its (lack of) gameplay, as well as for its "clunky interface", interminable dialogues, absence of music and very long loading times,<ref name="GAF"/> it was nonetheless remarked for its (at the time) remarkable CG graphics, and its beautiful backgrounds.<ref name="GAF"/>

Despite the positive feedback the television series had received, Anime Academy gave the series a 75%, partly due to the "lifeless" setting it had.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animeacademy.com/finalrevdisplay.php?id=201 |title=Serial Experiments: Lain |date=2002-03-16 |access-date=2015-04-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110927060034/http://www.animeacademy.com/finalrevdisplay.php?id=201 |archive-date=September 27, 2011 }}</ref> Michael Poirier of ''EX'' magazine stated that the last three episodes fail to resolve the questions in other DVD volumes.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ex.org/5.2/25-anime_followup_lain.html |title=Serial Experiments Lain - Buried Treasure |date=2000-05-11 |access-date=2015-04-17 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110826092828/http://www.ex.org/5.2/25-anime_followup_lain.html |archive-date=August 26, 2011 }}</ref> Justin Sevakis of Anime News Network noted that the English dub was decent, but that the show relied so little on dialogue that it hardly mattered.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2008-11-20/serial-experiments-lain|title=Serial Experiments Lain - Buried Treasure|date=2008-11-20|access-date=2015-04-17|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403122125/http://www.animenewsnetwork.com/buried-treasure/2008-11-20/serial-experiments-lain|archive-date=2015-04-03|url-status=live}}</ref>
