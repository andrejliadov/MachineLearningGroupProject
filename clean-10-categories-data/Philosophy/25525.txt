A native of the [[Kingdom of France]], he spent about 20 years (1629–1649) of his life in the [[Dutch Republic]] after serving for a while in the [[Dutch States Army]] of [[Maurice, Prince of Orange|Maurice of Nassau]], [[Prince of Orange]] and the [[Stadtholder]] of the [[Dutch Republic|United Provinces]]. One of the most notable intellectual figures of the [[Dutch Golden Age]],<ref>[[Steven Nadler|Nadler, Steven]]. 2015. ''The Philosopher, the Priest, and the Painter: A Portrait of Descartes''. Princeton University Press. {{ISBN|978-0-691-16575-2}}.</ref> Descartes is also widely regarded as one of the founders of [[modern philosophy]].

Many elements of Descartes's philosophy have precedents in late [[Aristotelianism]], the [[Neostoicism|revived Stoicism]] of the 16th century, or in earlier philosophers like [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]]. In his [[natural philosophy]], he differed from the [[Scholasticism|schools]] on two major points: first, he rejected the splitting of [[Matter|corporeal substance]] into matter and form; second, he rejected any appeal to [[Teleology|final ends]], divine or natural, in explaining natural phenomena.<ref>{{cite book |last=Carlson |first=Neil R. |title=Physiology of Behavior |publisher=Pearson: Allyn & Bacon |year=2001 |location=Needham Heights, Massachusetts |page=8 |isbn=978-0-205-30840-8 }}</ref> In his theology, he insists on the absolute freedom of [[Creationism|God's act of creation]]. Refusing to accept the authority of previous philosophers, Descartes frequently set his views apart from the philosophers who preceded him. In the opening section of the ''[[Passions of the Soul]]'', an [[Early modern period|early modern]] treatise on emotions, Descartes goes so far as to assert that he will write on this topic "as if no one had written on these matters before." His best known philosophical statement is "{{lang-la|link=no|[[cogito, ergo sum]]|label=none}}" ("I think, therefore I am"; {{lang-fr|link=no|Je pense, donc je suis}}), found in ''[[Discourse on the Method]]'' (1637; in French and Latin) and ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'' (1644, in Latin).<ref>This idea had already been proposed by [[Spanish philosophy|Spanish philosopher]] [[Gómez Pereira]] a hundred years ago in the form: "I know that I know something, anyone who knows exists, then I exist" (''nosco me aliquid noscere, & quidquid noscit, est, ergo ego sum''). {{Bulleted list|Pereira, Gómez. 1749 [1554].

In ''Historia de Medina del Campo y su Tierra, volumen I: Nacimiento y expansión'', edited by E. L. Sanz.}}</ref>

Descartes has often been called the father of [[modern philosophy]], and is largely seen as responsible for the increased attention given to [[epistemology]] in the 17th century.<ref name="Russell2004p516">[[Bertrand Russell]] (2004) [https://books.google.com/books?id=Ey94E3sOMA0C&pg=PA516 ''History of western philosophy''] pp. 511, 516–17</ref><ref>See also: [[wiktionary:epistemological turn|Epistemological turn]].</ref> He laid the foundation for 17th-century continental [[rationalism]], later advocated by [[Baruch Spinoza|Spinoza]] and [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz|Leibniz]], and was later opposed by the [[Empiricism|empiricist]] school of thought consisting of [[Thomas Hobbes|Hobbes]], [[John Locke|Locke]], [[George Berkeley|Berkeley]], and [[David Hume|Hume]]. In the 17th-century Dutch Republic, the rise of early modern rationalism – as a highly systematic school of philosophy in its own right for the first time in history – exerted an immense and profound influence on modern Western thought in general, with the birth of two influential rationalistic philosophical systems of Descartes (who spent most of his adult life and wrote all his major work in the United Provinces of the Netherlands) and Spinoza – namely [[Cartesianism]] and [[Spinozism]]. It was the 17th-century arch-rationalists like Descartes, Spinoza and Leibniz who have given the "[[Age of Enlightenment|Age of Reason]]" its name and place in history. Leibniz, Spinoza,<ref>Moorman, R. H. 1943. "[http://www.faculty.umb.edu/gary_zabel/Courses/Spinoza/Texts/The%20Influence%20of%20Mathematics%20on%20the%20Philosophy%20of%20Spinoza.pdf The Influence of Mathematics on the Philosophy of Spinoza]." ''[[Mathematics Magazine|National Mathematics Magazine]]'' 18(3):108–15.</ref> and Descartes were all well-versed in mathematics as well as philosophy, and Descartes and Leibniz contributed greatly to science as well.<ref>[[Jean Grondin|Grondin, J.]], ''Introduction to Metaphysics: From Parmenides to Levinas'' ([[New York City|New York]]: [[Columbia University Press]], 2004), [https://books.google.com/books?id=6Kvn-xYnWX8C&pg=PA126 p. 126].</ref>

Descartes's ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'' (1641) continues to be a standard text at most university philosophy departments. Descartes's influence in mathematics is equally apparent; the [[Cartesian coordinate system]] was [[#Mathematical legacy|named after him]]. He is credited as the father of [[analytical geometry]], the bridge between [[algebra]] and [[geometry]]—used in the discovery of infinitesimal [[calculus]] and [[Mathematical analysis|analysis]]. Descartes was also one of the key figures in the [[Scientific Revolution]].

<blockquote>I entirely abandoned the study of letters. Resolving to seek no knowledge other than that of which could be found in myself or else in the great book of the world, I spent the rest of my youth traveling, visiting courts and armies, mixing with people of diverse temperaments and ranks, gathering various experiences, testing myself in the situations which fortune offered me, and at all times reflecting upon whatever came my way to derive some profit from it.</blockquote>

In accordance with his ambition to become a professional military officer, in 1618 Descartes joined, as a [[mercenary]], the [[Protestant]] [[Dutch States Army]] in Breda under the command of [[Maurice of Nassau]],<ref name=":3" /> and undertook a formal study of [[military engineering]], as established by [[Simon Stevin]].<ref name=":7">Gaukroger, Stephen. 1995.

===Visions===
According to [[Adrien Baillet]], on the night of 10–11 November 1619 ([[St. Martin's Day]]), while stationed in [[Neuburg an der Donau]], Descartes shut himself in a room with an "oven" (probably a [[cocklestove]])<ref>Rothkamm, J., ''Institutio Oratoria: Bacon, Descartes, Hobbes, Spinoza'' (Leiden & Boston: [[Brill Publishers|Brill]], 2009), [https://books.google.com/books?id=5bH3_u4g3cMC&pg=PA40 p. 40].</ref> to escape the cold.

=== France ===
In 1620 Descartes left the army. He visited [[Basilica della Santa Casa]] in Loreto, then visited various countries before returning to France, and during the next few years spent time in Paris.

[[File:Westermarkt 6, Descarteshuis (links).JPG|thumb|In [[Amsterdam]], Descartes lived at Westermarkt 6 (Maison Descartes, left).]]

Descartes returned to the [[Dutch Republic]] in 1628.<ref name=":4" /> In April 1629 he joined the [[University of Franeker]], studying under [[Adriaan Metius]], either living with a Catholic family or renting the [[Sjaerdemaslot]]. The next year, under the name "Poitevin", he enrolled at the [[Leiden University]] to study mathematics with [[Jacobus Golius]], who confronted him with [[Pappus's hexagon theorem]], and [[astronomy]] with [[Martin van den Hove|Martin Hortensius]].<ref>[[A. C. Grayling|Grayling, A. C.]] 2006. ''Descartes: The Life of René Descartes and Its Place in His Times''.

In Amsterdam, he had a relationship with a servant girl, Helena Jans van der Strom, with whom he had a daughter, [[Francine Descartes|Francine]], who was born in 1635 in [[Deventer]]. She died of scarlet fever at the age of 5.

Unlike many moralists of the time, Descartes did not deprecate the passions but rather defended them; he wept upon Francine's death in 1640.<ref>{{cite book |last=Durant |first=Will and Ariel |title=The Story of Civilization: Par VII, the Age of reason Begins |year=1961 |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York |isbn=978-0-671-01320-2 |page=[https://archive.org/details/ageofreasonbegin07dura_0/page/638 638] |url=https://archive.org/details/ageofreasonbegin07dura_0/page/638 }}</ref> According to a recent biography by Jason Porterfield, "Descartes said that he did not believe that one must refrain from tears to prove oneself a man."<ref>Porterfield, J., ''René Descartes'' (New York: [[Rosen Publishing]], 2018), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UEJgDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA66 p. 66].</ref> [[Russell Shorto]] speculates that the experience of fatherhood and losing a child formed a turning point in Descartes's work, changing its focus from medicine to a quest for universal answers.<ref>Russell Shorto, ''Descartes' Bones: A Skeletal History of the Conflict Between Faith and Reason'' {{ISBN|978-0-385-51753-9}} (New York, Random House, 2008)</ref>

Descartes continued to publish works concerning both mathematics and philosophy for the rest of his life. In 1641 he published a metaphysics treatise, ''Meditationes de Prima Philosophia'' (Meditations on First Philosophy), written in Latin and thus addressed to the learned. It was followed in 1644 by ''Principia Philosophiae'' (''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''), a kind of synthesis of the ''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Meditations on First Philosophy''. In 1643, Cartesian philosophy was condemned at the [[Utrecht University|University of Utrecht]], and Descartes was obliged to flee to the Hague, settling in [[Egmond-Binnen]].

[[Christia Mercer]] posits that the most influential ideas in ''Meditations on First Philosophy'' were lifted from Spanish author and Roman Catholic nun [[Teresa of Ávila]], who, fifty years earlier, published ''[[The Interior Castle]]'', concerning the role of philosophical reflection in intellectual growth.<ref name="CM2017">Mercer, C., [https://philpapers.org/rec/MERDDT "Descartes’ debt to Teresa of Ávila, or why we should work on women in the history of philosophy"], ''[[Philosophical Studies]]'' 174, 2017.</ref><ref>Craig, D.

Descartes began (through Alfonso Polloti, an Italian general in Dutch service) a six-year correspondence with [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], devoted mainly to moral and psychological subjects.<ref>Harth, E., ''Cartesian Women: Versions and Subversions of Rational Discourse in the Old Regime'', ([[Ithaca, New York|Ithaca]]: [[Cornell University Press]], 1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=9Mpe59dmSfEC&pg=PA67 pp. 67–77].</ref> Connected with this correspondence, in 1649 he published ''Les Passions de l'âme'' (Passions of the Soul), which he dedicated to the Princess.

===Sweden===

By 1649, Descartes had become one of Europe's most famous philosophers and scientists.<ref name=":5" /> That year, [[Queen Christina of Sweden]] invited Descartes to her court to organize a new scientific academy and tutor her in his ideas about love. She was interested in and stimulated Descartes to publish the "[[Passions of the Soul]]", a work based on his correspondence with Princess Elisabeth.<ref name="Smith">{{cite encyclopedia |last=Smith |first=Kurt |title=Descartes' Life and Works |encyclopedia=[[Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy]] |date=Fall 2010 |url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/descartes-works/}}</ref> Descartes accepted, and moved to Sweden in the middle of winter.<ref>{{Cite book|title=Math and mathematicians : the history of math discoveries around the world|last=Bruno|first=Leonard C.|date=2003|orig-year=1999|publisher=U X L|others=Baker, Lawrence W.|isbn=978-0-7876-3813-9|location=Detroit, Mich.|pages=[https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun/page/103 103]–4|oclc=41497065|url=https://archive.org/details/mathmathematicia00brun|url-access=registration}}</ref>

He was a guest at the house of [[Pierre Chanut]], living on [[Västerlånggatan]], less than 500 meters from [[Tre Kronor (castle)|Tre Kronor]] in [[Stockholm]]. There, Chanut and Descartes made observations with a [[Evangelista Torricelli|Torricellian]] mercury barometer. Challenging [[Blaise Pascal]], Descartes took the first set of barometric readings in Stockholm to see if [[atmospheric pressure]] could be used in forecasting the weather.<ref>''Modern meteorology: a series of six lectures: delivered under the auspices of the Meteorological Society in 1878'', 1879, [https://archive.org/details/modernmeteorolog00mete/page/72/mode/2up?q=Stockholm p. 73].</ref>

Descartes arranged to give lessons to Queen Christina after her birthday, three times a week at 5 am, in her cold and draughty castle. It soon became clear they did not like each other; she did not care for his [[Mechanical philosophy#Descartes and the mechanical philosophy|mechanical philosophy]], nor did he share her interest in [[Ancient Greek]]. By 15 January 1650, Descartes had seen Christina only four or five times.

==Philosophical work==
{{Further|Cartesianism}}

Initially, Descartes arrives at only a single first principle: I think. Thought cannot be separated from me, therefore, I exist (''Discourse on the Method'' and ''Principles of Philosophy''). Most notably, this is known as ''cogito ergo sum'' (English: "I think, therefore I am"). Therefore, Descartes concluded, if he doubted, then something or someone must be doing the doubting; therefore, the very fact that he doubted proved his existence. "The simple meaning of the phrase is that if one is skeptical of existence, that is in and of itself proof that he does exist."<ref>{{cite web|title=Ten books: Chosen by Raj Persuade|publisher=The [[British Journal of Psychiatry]]|url=http://bjp.rcpsych.org/cgi/content/full/181/3/258}}</ref> These two first principles—I think and I exist—were later confirmed by Descartes's clear and distinct perception (delineated in his [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Meditation III: Concerning God.2C That He Exists|Third Meditation]]): that I clearly and distinctly perceive these two principles, Descartes reasoned, ensures their indubitability.

Descartes concludes that he can be certain that he exists because he thinks. But in what form? He perceives his body through the use of the senses; however, these have previously been unreliable. So Descartes determines that the only indubitable knowledge is that he is a ''thinking thing''. Thinking is what he does, and his power must come from his essence. Descartes defines "thought" (''[[List of Latin phrases (C)|cogitatio]]'') as "what happens in me such that I am immediately conscious of it, insofar as I am conscious of it". Thinking is thus every activity of a person of which the person is immediately [[Consciousness|conscious]].<ref>{{cite book|last=Descartes|first=René|title=The Principles of Philosophy|year=1644|volume=IX}}</ref> He gave reasons for thinking that waking thoughts are distinguishable from [[dream argument|dreams]], and that one's mind cannot have been "hijacked" by an [[evil demon]] placing an illusory external world before one's senses.<ref name=":0" />

In this manner, Descartes proceeds to construct a system of knowledge, discarding [[perception]] as unreliable and, instead, admitting only [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] as a method.<ref name="Preface"/>

===Dualism===

[[File:L'homme V00083 00000004.tif|thumb|''L'homme'' (1664)]]

Descartes, influenced by the [[automaton]]s on display throughout the city of Paris, began to investigate the connection between the mind and body, and how the two interact.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://people.whitman.edu/~herbrawt/classes/339/Descartes.pdf |title='A Brute to the Brutes?': Descartes' Treatment of Animals |last=Cottingham |first=John |author-link=John Cottingham |access-date=24 February 2018 |work=Whitman People }}</ref> His main influences for [[Mind–body dualism|dualism]] were [[theology]] and [[physics]].<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor=20013943|title=What Moves the Mind: An Excursion in Cartesian Dualism |last=Watson |first=Richard A. |author-link=Richard Watson (philosopher) |date=January 1982 |journal=[[American Philosophical Quarterly]] |volume=19 |issue=1 |pages=73–81 |publisher=[[University of Illinois Press]]}}</ref> The theory on the dualism of mind and body is Descartes's signature doctrine and permeates other theories he advanced. Known as [[Cartesian dualism]] (or mind–body dualism), his theory on the separation between the mind and the body went on to influence subsequent Western philosophies.<ref>Gobert, R. D., [https://books.google.com/books?id=U8RwsQvrQRgC&printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&q&f=false ''The Mind-Body Stage: Passion and Interaction in the Cartesian Theater''] (Stanford: Stanford University Press, 2013).</ref> In ''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]'', Descartes attempted to demonstrate the existence of [[God]] and the distinction between the human soul and the body. Humans are a union of mind and body;<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=277}}</ref> thus Descartes's dualism embraced the idea that mind and body are distinct but closely joined. While many contemporary readers of Descartes found the distinction between mind and body difficult to grasp, he thought it was entirely straightforward. Descartes employed the concept of ''modes'', which are the ways in which substances exist. In ''[[Principles of Philosophy]]'', Descartes explained, "we can clearly perceive a substance apart from the mode which we say differs from it, whereas we cannot, conversely, understand the mode apart from the substance". To perceive a mode apart from its substance requires an intellectual abstraction,<ref name="David Cunning 2014 278">{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=278}}</ref> which Descartes explained as follows:

<blockquote>The intellectual abstraction consists in my turning my thought away from one part of the contents of this richer idea the better to apply it to the other part with greater attention. Thus, when I consider a shape without thinking of the substance or the extension whose shape it is, I make a mental abstraction.<ref name="David Cunning 2014 278"/>
</blockquote>

According to Descartes, two substances are really distinct when each of them can exist apart from the other. Thus Descartes reasoned that God is distinct from humans, and the body and mind of a human are also distinct from one another.<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=279}}</ref> He argued that the great differences between body (an extended thing) and mind (an un-extended, immaterial thing) make the two ontologically distinct. But that the mind was utterly indivisible: because "when I consider the mind, or myself in so far as I am merely a thinking thing, I am unable to distinguish any part within myself; I understand myself to be something quite single and complete."<ref>{{Cite book|title= The Cambridge Companion to Descartes' Meditations|author=David Cunning |publisher= Cambridge University Press|year=2014 |isbn=978-1-107-72914-8|page=280}}</ref>

In ''Meditations'' Descartes invokes his [[causal adequacy principle]]<ref>[[Georges Dicker|Dicker, G.]], ''Descartes: An Analytical and Historical Introduction'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2013), [https://books.google.com/books?id=UohoAgAAQBAJ&pg=PT138#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 118ff].</ref> to support his [[trademark argument]] for the existence of God, quoting Lucretius in defence: ''"Ex nihilo nihil fit"'', meaning "[[Nothing comes from nothing]]" ([[Lucretius]]).<ref>{{cite book

Moreover, in ''Meditations'' Descartes discusses a piece of [[wax]] and exposes the single most characteristic doctrine of Cartesian dualism: that the universe contained two radically different kinds of substances—the mind or soul defined as [[Thought|thinking]], and the body defined as matter and unthinking.<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=86}}</ref> The [[Aristotelianism|Aristotelian philosophy]] of Descartes's days held that the universe was inherently purposeful or teleological. Everything that happened, be it the motion of the [[star]]s or the growth of a [[tree]], was supposedly explainable by a certain purpose, goal or end that worked its way out within nature. Aristotle called this the "final cause," and these final causes were indispensable for explaining the ways nature operated. Descartes's theory of dualism supports the distinction between traditional Aristotelian science and the new science of [[Johannes Kepler|Kepler]] and Galileo, which denied the role of a divine power and "final causes" in its attempts to explain nature. Descartes's dualism provided the philosophical rationale for the latter by expelling the final cause from the physical universe (or ''res extensa'') in favor of the mind (or ''res cogitans''). Therefore, while Cartesian dualism paved the way for modern [[physics]], it also held the door open for religious beliefs about the immortality of the [[soul]].<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=87}}</ref>

Descartes's dualism of mind and matter implied a concept of human beings. A human was according to Descartes a composite entity of mind and body. Descartes gave priority to the mind and argued that the mind could exist without the body, but the body could not exist without the mind. In ''Meditations'' Descartes even argues that while the mind is a substance, the body is composed only of "accidents".<ref>{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=301}}</ref> But he did argue that mind and body are closely joined:<ref name="Georges Dicker 2013 303">{{Cite book|title= Descartes: An Analytic and Historical Introduction|author=Georges Dicker |publisher= OUP |year=2013 |isbn=978-0-19-538032-3|page=303}}</ref>

<blockquote>Nature also teaches me, by the sensations of pain, hunger, thirst and so on, that I am not merely present in my body as a pilot in his ship, but that I am very closely joined and, as it were, intermingled with it, so that I and the body form a unit. If this were not so, I, who am nothing but a thinking thing, would not feel pain when the body was hurt, but would perceive the damage purely by the intellect, just as a sailor perceives by sight if anything in his ship is broken.<ref name="Georges Dicker 2013 303"/>
</blockquote>

Descartes's discussion on embodiment raised one of the most perplexing problems of his dualism philosophy: What exactly is the relationship of union between the mind and the body of a person?<ref name="Georges Dicker 2013 303"/> Therefore, Cartesian dualism set the agenda for philosophical discussion of the [[mind–body problem]] for many years after Descartes's death.<ref>Stanford Encyclopaedia of Philosophy (online): Descartes and the Pineal Gland.</ref> Descartes was also a [[Rationalism|rationalist]] and believed in the power of [[Innatism|innate ideas]].<ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 88">{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=88}}</ref> Descartes argued the theory of [[innate knowledge]] and that all humans were born with knowledge through the higher power of God. It was this theory of innate knowledge that later led philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) to combat the theory of [[empiricism]], which held that all knowledge is acquired through experience.<ref>{{Cite journal |jstor=27532614 |title=John Locke's Contributions to Education |url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/pdf/27532614.pdf|last=Baldwin |first=Bird T. |date=April 1913 |publisher=[[The Johns Hopkins University Press]] |journal=[[The Sewanee Review]] |volume=21 |issue=2 |pages=177–187}}</ref>

===Physiology and psychology===
In ''The Passions of the Soul'', written between 1645 and 1646, Descartes discussed the common contemporary belief that the human body contained animal spirits. These animal spirits were believed to be light and roaming fluids circulating rapidly around the nervous system between the brain and the muscles, and served as a metaphor for feelings, like being in high or bad spirit. These animal spirits were believed to affect the human soul, or passions of the soul. Descartes distinguished six basic passions: wonder, love, hatred, desire, joy and sadness. All of these passions, he argued, represented different combinations of the original spirit, and influenced the soul to will or want certain actions. He argued, for example, that fear is a passion that moves the soul to generate a response in the body. In line with his dualist teachings on the separation between the soul and the body, he hypothesized that some part of the brain served as a connector between the soul and the body and singled out the [[pineal gland]] as connector.<ref>{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=86}}</ref> Descartes argued that signals passed from the ear and the eye to the pineal gland, through animal spirits. Thus different motions in the gland cause various animal spirits. He argued that these motions in the pineal gland are based on God's will and that humans are supposed to want and like things that are useful to them. But he also argued that the animal spirits that moved around the body could distort the commands from the pineal gland, thus humans had to learn how to control their passions.<ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 87">{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=87}}</ref>

Descartes advanced a theory on automatic bodily reactions to external events which influenced 19th-century [[reflex]] theory. He argued that external motions such as touch and sound reach the endings of the nerves and affect the animal spirits. Heat from fire affects a spot on the skin and sets in motion a chain of reactions, with the animal spirits reaching the brain through the central nervous system, and in turn animal spirits are sent back to the muscles to move the hand away from the fire.<ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 87"/> Through this chain of reactions the automatic reactions of the body do not require a thought process.<ref name="Eric Shiraev 2010 88"/>

Above all he was among the first scientists who believed that the soul should be subject to scientific investigation. He challenged the views of his contemporaries that the soul was [[Divinity|divine]], thus religious authorities regarded his books as dangerous. Descartes's writings went on to form the basis for theories on [[emotion]]s and how [[Cognition|cognitive]] evaluations were translated into affective processes. Descartes believed that the brain resembled a working machine and unlike many of his contemporaries believed that mathematics and mechanics could explain the most complicated processes of the mind. In the 20th century [[Alan Turing]] advanced [[computer science]] based on [[Mathematical and theoretical biology|mathematical biology]] as inspired by Descartes. His theories on reflexes also served as the foundation for advanced [[Physiology|physiological theories]] more than 200 years after his death. The physiologist [[Ivan Pavlov]] was a great admirer of Descartes.<ref>{{Cite book|title= A History of Psychology: A Global Perspective|author=Eric Shiraev |publisher= Sage|year=2010 |isbn=978-1-4129-7383-0|page=88}}</ref>

===Moral philosophy===
For Descartes, [[ethics]] was a science, the highest and most perfect of them. Like the rest of the sciences, ethics had its roots in metaphysics.<ref name="Preface"/> In this way, he argues for the existence of God, investigates the place of man in nature, formulates the theory of mind–body dualism, and defends [[free will]]. However, as he was a convinced rationalist, Descartes clearly states that reason is sufficient in the search for the goods that we should seek, and [[virtue]] consists in the correct reasoning that should guide our actions. Nevertheless, the quality of this reasoning depends on knowledge, because a well-informed mind will be more capable of making good [[choices]], and it also depends on mental condition. For this reason, he said that a complete moral philosophy should include the study of the body.<ref>Pickavé, M., & [[Lisa Shapiro|Shapiro, L.]], eds., ''Emotion and Cognitive Life in Medieval and Early Modern Philosophy'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2012), [https://books.google.com/books?id=oDZpAgAAQBAJ&pg=PA189 p. 189].</ref>{{rp|189}} He discussed this subject in the correspondence with [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate|Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia]], and as a result wrote his work ''The Passions of the Soul'', that contains a study of the [[Psychosomatic medicine|psychosomatic]] processes and reactions in man, with an emphasis on emotions or passions.<ref name="Blom">Blom, John J., Descartes. His moral philosophy and psychology. New York University Press. 1978. {{isbn|0-8147-0999-0}}</ref> His works about human passion and emotion would be the basis for the philosophy of his followers (see [[Cartesianism]]), and would have a lasting impact on ideas concerning what literature and art should be, specifically how it should invoke emotion.<ref>{{Cite book|title=The Scientific Revolution A Brief History with Documents|last=Jacob|first=Margaret C.|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|year=2009|isbn=978-0-312-65349-1|location=Boston|pages=16, 17}}</ref>

Humans should seek the [[summum bonum|sovereign good]] that Descartes, following [[Zeno of Citium|Zeno]], identifies with virtue, as this produces a solid [[Blessing|blessedness]] or [[pleasure]]. For [[Epicurus]] the sovereign good was pleasure, and Descartes says that, in fact, this is not in contradiction with Zeno's teaching, because virtue produces a spiritual pleasure, that is better than bodily pleasure. Regarding [[Aristotle]]'s opinion that happiness depends on the goods of fortune, Descartes does not deny that this good contributes to happiness but remarks that they are in great proportion outside one's own control, whereas one's mind is under one's complete control.<ref name="Blom"/> The moral writings of Descartes came at the last part of his life, but earlier, in his ''Discourse on the Method'' he adopted three maxims to be able to act while he put all his ideas into doubt. This is known as his [[Discourse on the Method#Part III: Morals, and Maxims accepted while conducting Method|"Provisional Morals"]].

=== Religion ===
[[File:Descartes3.jpg|thumb|René Descartes at work]]
In the third and fifth ''Meditation'', Descartes offers [[Ontological argument|ontological proof]] of a benevolent God (through both the ontological argument and [[trademark argument]]). Because God is benevolent, Descartes can have some faith in the account of reality his senses provide him, for God has provided him with a working mind and [[Sensory nervous system|sensory system]] and does not desire to deceive him. From this supposition, however, Descartes finally establishes the possibility of acquiring knowledge about the world based on deduction ''and'' perception. Regarding [[epistemology]], therefore, Descartes can be said to have contributed such ideas as a rigorous conception of [[foundationalism]] and the possibility that [[reason]] is the only reliable method of attaining knowledge. Descartes, however, was very much aware that experimentation was necessary to verify and validate theories.<ref name="Preface"/>

In his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', Descartes sets forth two proofs for God's existence. One of these is founded on the possibility of thinking the "idea of a being that is supremely perfect and infinite," and suggests that "of all the ideas that are in me, the idea that I have of God is the most true, the most clear and distinct."<ref>Descartes, Rene "Meditations on First Philosophy, 3rd Ed., Translated from Latin by: Donald A. Cress</ref> Descartes considered himself to be a devout Catholic,<ref name="books.google.be" /><ref name="KrR-5EKLSQMC p. 207" /><ref name="Gh_BAAAQBAJ p. 107" /> and one of the purposes of the ''Meditations'' was to defend the Catholic faith. His attempt to ground theological beliefs on reason encountered intense opposition in his time. [[Blaise Pascal|Pascal]] regarded Descartes's views as a rationalist and mechanist, and accused him of [[deism]]: "I cannot forgive Descartes; in all his philosophy, Descartes did his best to dispense with God. But Descartes could not avoid prodding God to set the world in motion with a snap of his lordly fingers; after that, he had no more use for God," while a powerful contemporary, [[Martin Schoock]], accused him of [[Atheism|atheist]] beliefs, though Descartes had provided an explicit critique of atheism in his ''Meditations''. The Catholic Church prohibited his books in 1663.<ref name="Descartes, René 2009"/><ref>Edward C. Mendler, ''False Truths: The Error of Relying on Authority'', p. 16</ref><ref>Peterson, L. L., ''American Trinity: Jefferson, Custer, and the Spirit of the West'' ([[Helena, Montana|Helena, MT]]: Sweetgrass Books, 2017), [https://books.google.com/books?id=uKIoDwAAQBAJ&pg=PA274 p. 274].</ref>{{rp|274}} Descartes also wrote a response to [[Philosophical skepticism|external world skepticism]]. Through this method of scepticism, he does not doubt for the sake of doubting but to achieve concrete and reliable information. In other words, certainty. He argues that sensory [[perception]]s come to him involuntarily, and are not willed by him. They are external to his senses, and according to Descartes, this is evidence of the existence of something outside of his mind, and thus, an external world. Descartes goes on to show that the things in the external world are material by arguing that God would not deceive him as to the ideas that are being transmitted, and that God has given him the "propensity" to believe that such ideas are caused by material things. Descartes also believes a substance is something that does not need any assistance to function or exist. Descartes further explains how only God can be a true “substance”. But minds are substances, meaning they need only God for it to function. The mind is a thinking substance. The means for a thinking substance stem from ideas.<ref name=":1">{{cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/descarte/|title=Descartes, Rene {{!}} Internet Encyclopaedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|language=en-US|access-date=2017-02-22}}</ref>

Descartes steered clear of theological questions, restricting his attention to showing that there is no incompatibility between his metaphysics and theological orthodoxy. He avoided trying to demonstrate theological dogmas metaphysically. When challenged that he had not established the immortality of the soul merely in showing that the soul and the body are distinct substances, for example, he replied, "I do not take it upon myself to try to use the power of human reason to settle any of those matters which depend on the free will of God."<ref>{{Cite book|title=Descartes - An Intellectual Biography|last=Gaukroger|first=Stephen|publisher=Clarendon Press|year=1995|isbn=978-0-19-823994-9|location=Oxford University Press Inc., New York|pages=355–356}}</ref>

===Natural science===
Descartes is often regarded as the first thinker to emphasize the use of reason to develop the [[natural science]]s.<ref>

In his ''Discourse on the Method'', he attempts to arrive at a fundamental set of principles that one can know as true without any doubt. To achieve this, he employs a method called hyperbolical/metaphysical doubt, also sometimes referred to as [[Cartesian doubt|methodological skepticism]]: he rejects any ideas that can be doubted and then re-establishes them in order to acquire a firm foundation for genuine knowledge.<ref>{{cite web |first=Rebecca |last=Copenhaver |title=Forms of skepticism |url=http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20050108095032/http://www.lclark.edu/~rebeccac/forms.html |archive-date=8 January 2005 |accessdate=15 August 2007}}</ref> Descartes built his ideas from scratch. He relates this to architecture: the top soil is taken away to create a new building or structure. Descartes calls his doubt the soil and new knowledge the buildings.

===On animals===
Descartes denied that animals had reason or intelligence.<ref>Waddicor, M.

==Historical impact==
===Emancipation from Church doctrine===
[[File:DescartesMeditations.png|thumb|Cover of ''Meditations'']]

Descartes has often been dubbed the father of modern [[Western philosophy]], the thinker whose approach has profoundly changed the course of Western philosophy and set the basis for [[modernity]].<ref name="Russell2004p516"/><ref>Heidegger [1938] (2002), p. 76 quotation: {{quote|Descartes... that which he himself founded... modern (and that means, at the same time, Western) metaphysics.}}</ref> The first two of his ''Meditations on First Philosophy'', those that formulate the famous [[Cartesian doubt|methodic doubt]], represent the portion of Descartes's writings that most influenced modern thinking.<ref>[[Tad Schmaltz|Schmaltz, Tad M.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=pIYcUBCOrNgC&pg=PA27 ''Radical Cartesianism: The French Reception of Descartes''] p. 27 quotation: {{quote|The Descartes most familiar to twentieth-century philosophers is the Descartes of the first two ''Meditations'', someone proccupied with hyperbolic doubt of the material world and the certainty of knowledge of the self that emerges from the famous cogito argument.}}</ref> It has been argued that Descartes himself did not realize the extent of this revolutionary move.<ref>[[Roy Wood Sellars]] (1949) [https://archive.org/details/philosophyforfut00sell ''Philosophy for the future: the quest of modern materialism''] quotation: {{quote|Husserl has taken Descartes very seriously in a historical as well as in a systematic sense [...] [in ''The Crisis of the European Sciences and Transcendental Phenomenology'', Husserl] finds in the first two Meditations of Descartes a depth which it is difficult to fathom, and which Descartes himself was so little able to appreciate that he let go "the great discovery" he had in his hands.}}</ref> In shifting the debate from "what is true" to "of what can I be certain?", Descartes arguably shifted the authoritative guarantor of truth from God to humanity (even though Descartes himself claimed he received his visions from God)—while the traditional concept of "truth" implies an external authority, "certainty" instead relies on the judgment of the individual.

In an [[Anthropocentrism|anthropocentric]] revolution, the human being is now raised to the level of a subject, an agent, an [[Emancipation|emancipated]] being equipped with autonomous reason. This was a revolutionary step that established the basis of modernity, the repercussions of which are still being felt: the emancipation of humanity from Christian [[revelation]]al truth and [[Catholic Church|Church doctrine]]; humanity making its own law and taking its own stand.<ref name="Heidegger1938emancipated">Martin Heidegger [1938] (2002) ''The Age of the World Picture'' quotation: {{quote|For up to Descartes...a particular ''sub-iectum''...lies at the foundation of its own fixed qualities and changing circumstances.

This anthropocentric perspective of Descartes's work, establishing human reason as autonomous, provided the basis for the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s emancipation from God and the Church.

===Mathematical legacy===
[[File:Cartesian coordinates 2D.svg|thumb|A Cartesian coordinates graph, using his invented ''x'' and ''y'' axes]]

One of Descartes's most enduring legacies was his development of [[analytic geometry|Cartesian or analytic geometry]], which uses algebra to describe geometry. Descartes "invented the convention of representing unknowns in equations by ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'', and knowns by ''a'', ''b'', and ''c''". He also "pioneered the standard notation" that uses [[Subscript and superscript|superscripts]] to show the powers or exponents; for example, the 2 used in x<sup>2</sup> to indicate x squared.<ref>René Descartes, ''Discourse de la Méthode'' (Leiden, Netherlands): Jan Maire, 1637, appended book: ''La Géométrie'', book one, [http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/btv1b86069594/f383.image p. 299.] From p. 299: ''" ...

[https://books.google.com/books?id=kCNz9Nbe2JQC&pg=PT19#v=onepage&q&f=false p. 19].</ref>{{rp|19}} He was first to assign a fundamental place for algebra in the system of knowledge, using it as a method to automate or mechanize reasoning, particularly about abstract, unknown quantities.<ref>[[Stephen Gaukroger|Gaukroger, S.]], "The nature of abstract reasoning: philosophical aspects of Descartes' work in algebra", in [[John Cottingham|J. Cottingham]], ed., ''The Cambridge Companion to Descartes'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1992), [https://books.google.com/books?id=Prhr9FBdQ_MC&pg=PA91#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 91–114].</ref>{{rp|91–114}} European mathematicians had previously viewed geometry as a more fundamental form of mathematics, serving as the foundation of algebra. Algebraic rules were given geometric proofs by mathematicians such as [[Luca Pacioli|Pacioli]], [[Gerolamo Cardano|Cardan]], [[Niccolò Fontana Tartaglia|Tartaglia]] and [[Lodovico Ferrari|Ferrari]]. Equations of [[Degree of a polynomial|degree]] higher than the third were regarded as unreal, because a three-dimensional form, such as a cube, occupied the largest dimension of reality. Descartes professed that the abstract quantity ''a<sup>2</sup>'' could represent length as well as an area. This was in opposition to the teachings of mathematicians such as [[François Viète]], who insisted that a second power must represent an area. Although Descartes did not pursue the subject, he preceded [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]] in envisioning a more general science of algebra or "universal mathematics," as a precursor to [[Mathematical logic|symbolic logic]], that could encompass logical principles and methods symbolically, and mechanize general reasoning.<ref>[[Morris Kline]], ''Mathematical Thought from Ancient to Modern Times'', Vol. 1 (1972).

Descartes's work provided the basis for the [[calculus]] developed by [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] and Leibniz, who applied infinitesimal calculus to the [[Tangent#Analytical approach|tangent line problem]], thus permitting the evolution of that branch of modern mathematics.<ref>{{cite book |first=Jan |last=Gullberg |author-link=Jan Gullberg |year=1997 |title=Mathematics From The Birth of Numbers |url=https://archive.org/details/mathematicsfromb1997gull |url-access=registration |publisher=W.W.

The beginning to Descartes's interest in physics is accredited to the amateur scientist and mathematician [[Isaac Beeckman]], who was at the forefront of a new school of thought known as [[mechanical philosophy]]. With this foundation of reasoning, Descartes formulated many of his theories on [[Geometric mechanics|mechanical and geometric physics]].<ref name=Slowik>{{cite encyclopedia|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2017/entries/descartes-physics/|last=Slowik|first=Edward|title=Descartes' Physics |encyclopedia=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy Archive|date=22 August 2017|editor=Edward N.

Descartes also made contributions to the field of [[optics]]. He showed by using geometric construction and the [[law of refraction]] (also known as Descartes's law, or more commonly [[Snell's law]] outside France) that the angular radius of a [[rainbow]] is 42 degrees (i.e., the angle subtended at the eye by the edge of the rainbow and the ray passing from the sun through the rainbow's centre is 42°).<ref>{{cite book |last=Tipler |first=P.A. and G.

===Influence on Newton's mathematics===
Current popular opinion holds that Descartes had the most influence of anyone on the young Newton, and this is arguably one of his most important contributions. Decartes's influence extended not directly from his original French edition of ''[[La Géométrie]]'', however, but rather from [[Frans van Schooten]]'s expanded second Latin edition of the work.<ref>[[Richard S. Westfall|Westfall, R. S.]], ''Never at Rest: A Biography of Isaac Newton'' (Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1980), [https://books.google.com/books?id=3ngEugMMa9YC&pg=PT100 p. 100].</ref>{{rp|100}} Newton continued Descartes's work on [[cubic equation]]s, which will free the subject from fetters of the Greek perspectives. The most important concept was his very modern treatment of single variables.<ref>Whiteside, D. T., "Newton the Mathematician", in Z. Bechler, ed., ''Contemporary Newtonian Research'' (Berlin/Heidelberg: Springer, 1982), [https://books.google.de/books?id=LP3nCAAAQBAJ&pg=PA109#v=onepage&q&f=false pp. 109–129].</ref>{{rp|109–129}}

===Contemporary reception===
In commercial terms, ''Discourse'' appeared during Descartes's lifetime in a single edition of 500 copies, 200 of which were set aside for the author. Sharing a similar fate was the only French edition of ''Meditations'', which had not managed to sell out by the time of Descartes's death. A concomitant Latin edition of the latter was, however, eagerly sought out by Europe's scholarly community and proved a commercial success for Descartes.<ref>Maclean, I., introduction to Descartes, R., ''A Discourse on the Method of Correctly Conducting One's Reason and Seeking Truth in the Sciences'' (Oxford: Oxford University Press, 2006), [https://books.google.com/books?id=f9B3zzrPOY4C&pg=PR43 pp. xliii–xliv].</ref>{{rp|xliii–xliv}}

Although Descartes was well known in academic circles towards the end of his life, the teaching of his works in schools was controversial. Henri de Roy ([[Henricus Regius]], 1598–1679), Professor of Medicine at the University of Utrecht, was condemned by the Rector of the University, [[Gisbertus Voetius|Gijsbert Voet]] (Voetius), for teaching Descartes's physics.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Cottingham |first1=John |author-link=John Cottingham |first2=Dugald |last2=Murdoch |first3=Robert |last3=Stoothof |title=The Philosophical Writings of Descartes |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T5cSfRS4m5QC&pg=PA293 |chapter=Comments on a Certain Broadsheet |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1984 |page=293 |isbn=978-0-521-28807-1}}</ref>

* 1626–1628. ''Regulae ad directionem ingenii'' (''[[Rules for the Direction of the Mind]]''). Incomplete. First published posthumously in Dutch translation in 1684 and in the original Latin at Amsterdam in 1701 (''R. Des-Cartes Opuscula Posthuma Physica et Mathematica''). The best critical edition, which includes the Dutch translation of 1684, is edited by Giovanni Crapulli (The Hague: Martinus Nijhoff, 1966).
* c. 1630. ''De solidorum elementis''. Concerns the classification of [[Platonic solid]]s and three-dimensional [[figurate number]]s. Said by some scholars to prefigure [[Euler's polyhedral formula]]. Unpublished; discovered in Descartes' estate in Stockholm 1650, soaked for three days in the Seine in a shipwreck while being shipped back to Paris, copied in 1676 by Leibniz, and lost. Leibniz's copy, also lost, was rediscovered circa 1860 in Hannover.<ref>{{cite book|title=Descartes on Polyhedra: A Study of the "De solidorum elementis"|title-link=Descartes on Polyhedra|first=Pasquale Joseph|last=Federico|author-link=Pasquale Joseph Federico|series= Sources in the History of Mathematics and Physical Sciences|volume=4|publisher=Springer|year=1982}}</ref>

* 1630–1633. ''Le Monde'' (''[[The World (Descartes)|The World]]'') and ''L'Homme'' (''Man''). Descartes's first systematic presentation of his natural philosophy. ''Man'' was published posthumously in Latin translation in 1662; and ''The World'' posthumously in 1664.
* 1637. ''Discours de la méthode'' (''[[Discourse on the Method]]''). An introduction to the ''Essais'', which include the ''Dioptrique'', the ''Météores'' and the ''Géométrie''.
* 1637. ''[[La Géométrie]]'' (''Geometry''). Descartes's major work in mathematics. There is an English translation by Michael Mahoney (New York: Dover, 1979).
* 1641. ''Meditationes de prima philosophia'' (''[[Meditations on First Philosophy]]''), also known as ''Metaphysical Meditations''. In Latin; a second edition, published the following year, included an additional objection and reply, and a ''Letter to Dinet''. A French translation by the [[Duke of Luynes]], probably done without Descartes's supervision, was published in 1647. Includes six [[Meditations on First Philosophy#Objections and replies|Objections and Replies]].
* 1644. ''Principia philosophiae'' (''[[Principles of Philosophy]]''), a Latin textbook at first intended by Descartes to replace the Aristotelian textbooks then used in universities. A French translation, ''Principes de philosophie'' by Claude Picot, under the supervision of Descartes, appeared in 1647 with a letter-preface to Princess Elisabeth of Bohemia.
* 1647. ''Notae in programma'' (''Comments on a Certain Broadsheet''). A reply to Descartes's one-time disciple Henricus Regius.

Rediscovered in 1895 and published for the first time in 1896. An annotated bilingual edition (Latin with French translation), edited by Jean-Marie Beyssade, was published in 1981 (Paris: PUF).
* 1649. ''Les passions de l'âme'' (''[[Passions of the Soul]]''). Dedicated to Princess [[Elisabeth of the Palatinate]].
* 1657. ''Correspondance'' (three volumes: 1657, 1659, 1667). Published by Descartes's literary executor [[Claude Clerselier]]. The third edition, in 1667, was the most complete; Clerselier omitted, however, much of the material pertaining to mathematics.

In January 2010, a previously unknown letter from Descartes, dated 27 May 1641, was found by the Dutch philosopher Erik-Jan Bos when browsing through [[Google Search|Google]]. Bos found the letter mentioned in a summary of autographs kept by [[Haverford College]] in [[Haverford, Pennsylvania]]. The college was unaware that the letter had never been published. This was the third letter by Descartes found in the last 25 years.<ref>{{cite news |last=Vlasblom |first=Dirk |url=http://www.nrc.nl/international/article2492445.ece/Unknown_letter_from_Descartes_found |title=Unknown letter from Descartes found |newspaper=[[NRC.nl]] |date=25 February 2010 |access-date=30 May 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161108023903/http://vorige.nrc.nl/international/article2492445.ece/Unknown_letter_from_Descartes_found |archive-date=8 November 2016 |language=nl |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref><ref>{{cite news |language=nl |url=http://www.nrc.nl/wetenschap/article2491995.ece/Hoe_Descartes_in_1641_op_andere_gedachten_kwam |title=Hoe Descartes in 1641 op andere gedachten kwam |last=Vlasblom |first=Dirk |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161027192606/http://vorige.nrc.nl/wetenschap/article2491995.ece/Hoe_Descartes_in_1641_op_andere_gedachten_kwam |archive-date=27 October 2016 |newspaper=[[NRC.nl]]}}</ref>
