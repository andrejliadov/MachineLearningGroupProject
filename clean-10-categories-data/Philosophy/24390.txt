Examples outside logic include the [[ship of Theseus]] from philosophy, a paradox which questions whether a ship repaired over time by replacing each and all of its wooden parts, one at a time, would remain the same ship.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://faculty.washington.edu/smcohen/320/theseus.html|title=Identity, Persistence, and the Ship of Theseus|website=faculty.washington.edu|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> Paradoxes can also take the form of images or other media.

Common themes in paradoxes include [[self-reference]], [[infinite regress]], [[circular definition]]s, and confusion or equivocation between different levels of [[abstraction]].

;Self-reference:An example is the statement "This statement is false", a form of the [[liar paradox]]. The statement is referring to itself. Another example of self-reference is the question of whether the [[barber]] shaves himself in the [[barber paradox]]. Yet another example involves the question "Is the answer to this question 'No'?"
;Contradiction:"This statement is false"; the statement cannot be false and true at the same time. Another example of contradiction is if a man talking to a genie wishes that wishes couldn't come true. This contradicts itself because if the genie grants his wish, he did not grant his wish, and if he refuses to grant his wish, then he did indeed grant his wish, therefore making it impossible either to grant or not grant his wish without leading to a contradiction.
;Vicious circularity, or infinite regress: "This statement is false"; if the statement is true, then the statement is false, thereby making the statement true. Another example of [[vicious circle|vicious circularity]] is the following group of statements:
:: "The following sentence is true."
:: "The previous sentence is false."

Other paradoxes involve false statements and [[half-truth]]s ("''impossible'' is not in my vocabulary") or rely on a hasty assumption. (A father and his son are in a car crash; the father is killed and the boy is rushed to the hospital. The doctor says, "I can't operate on this boy. He's my son." There is no paradox [[Howler (error)|if]] the boy's mother is a surgeon.)

Paradoxes which are not based on a hidden error generally occur at the fringes of context or [[language]], and require extending the context or language in order to lose their paradoxical quality. Paradoxes that arise from apparently intelligible uses of language are often of interest to [[logic]]ians and [[philosopher]]s. "This sentence is false" is an example of the well-known [[liar paradox]]: it is a sentence which cannot be consistently interpreted as either true or false, because if it is known to be false, then it can be inferred that it must be true, and if it is known to be true, then it can be inferred that it must be false. [[Russell's paradox]], which shows that the notion of ''the [[set (mathematics)|set]] of all those sets that do not contain themselves'' leads to a contradiction, was instrumental in the development of modern logic and set theory.<ref name=":1" />

[[Thought-experiment]]s can also yield interesting paradoxes. The [[grandfather paradox]], for example, would arise if a [[time-travel]]er were to kill his own grandfather before his mother or father had been conceived, thereby preventing his own birth.<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://brilliant.org/wiki/introduction-to-paradoxes/|title=Introduction to paradoxes {{!}} Brilliant Math & Science Wiki|website=brilliant.org|language=en-us|access-date=2019-12-05}}</ref> This is a specific example of the more general observation of the [[butterfly effect]], or that a time-traveller's interaction with the past—however slight—would entail making changes that would, in turn, change the future in which the time-travel was yet to occur, and would thus change the circumstances of the time-travel itself.

Often a seemingly paradoxical conclusion arises from an inconsistent or inherently contradictory definition of the initial premise. In the case of that apparent paradox of a time-traveler killing his own grandfather, it is the inconsistency of defining the past to which he returns as being somehow different from the one which leads up to the future from which he begins his trip, but also insisting that he must have come to that past from the same future as the one that it leads up to.

==Quine's classification<!--"Quine's classification of paradoxes", "Veridical paradox", and "Falsidical paradox" redirect here-->==

{{See also|Veridicality}}

[[W. V. O. Quine]] (1962) distinguished between three classes of paradoxes:<ref>{{cite book | title = The Ways of Paradox, and other essays | last1 = Quine | first1 = W.V. | author-link = W.V. Quine | year = 1966 | publisher = Random House | location = New York | chapter = The ways of paradox | isbn = 9780674948358 |chapter-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YReOv31gdVIC&q=%22The+ways+of+paradox%22&pg=PA1}}</ref>

According to '''Quine's classification of paradoxes'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA-->:
* A '''veridical paradox'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> produces a result that appears absurd, but is demonstrated to be true nonetheless. The paradox of Frederic's birthday in ''[[The Pirates of Penzance]]'' establishes the surprising fact that a twenty-one-year-old would have had only five birthdays had he been born on a [[leap day]]. Likewise, [[Arrow's impossibility theorem]] demonstrates difficulties in mapping voting results to the will of the people. One version of the [[Monty Hall paradox]] demonstrates that a decision which has an intuitive fifty–fifty chance is in fact heavily biased towards making a decision which, given the intuitive conclusion, the player would be unlikely to make. In 20th-century science, [[Hilbert's paradox of the Grand Hotel]] and [[Schrödinger's cat]] are famously vivid examples of a theory being taken to a logical but paradoxical end.
* A '''falsidical paradox'''<!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--> establishes a result that not only ''appears'' false but actually ''is'' false, due to a fallacy in the demonstration. The various [[invalid proof|invalid mathematical proofs]] (e.g., that 1 = 2) are classic examples of this, often relying on a hidden [[division by zero]]. Another example is the inductive form of the [[All horses are the same colour|horse paradox]], which falsely generalises from true specific statements. [[Zeno's paradoxes]] are 'falsidical', concluding, for example, that a flying arrow never reaches its target or that a speedy runner cannot catch up to a tortoise with a small head-start.
* A paradox that is in neither class may be an [[antinomy]], which reaches a self-contradictory result by properly applying accepted ways of reasoning. For example, the [[Grelling–Nelson paradox]] points out genuine problems in our understanding of the ideas of truth and description.

A fourth kind, which may be alternatively interpreted as a special case of the third kind, has sometimes been described since Quine's work:
* A paradox that is both true and false at the same time and in the same sense is called a ''[[dialetheia]]''. In Western logics, it is often assumed, following [[Aristotle]], that no ''dialetheia'' exist, but they are sometimes accepted in Eastern traditions (e.g. in the [[Mohists]],<ref name="SchoolOfNames">The [[School of Names|Logicians]] ([[Warring States period]]),[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/school-names/paradoxes.html "Miscellaneous paradoxes"] ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''</ref> the [[Gongsun Longzi]],<ref name="Graham-studies334">Graham, Angus Charles. (1990). {{google books|TD43k809CT8C|''Studies in Chinese Philosophy and Philosophical Literature,'' p. 334.|page=334}}</ref> and in [[Zen]]<ref>Chung-ying Cheng (1973) "[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenEssays/Philosophical/OnZenLanguage.htm On Zen (Ch’an) Language and Zen Paradoxes]" ''Journal of Chinese Philosophy'', '''V. 1''' (1973) pp. 77-102</ref>) and in [[paraconsistent logic]]s. It would be mere equivocation or a matter of degree, for example, to both affirm and deny that "John is here" when John is halfway through the door, but it is self-contradictory simultaneously to affirm and deny the event.

==In philosophy==

A taste for paradox is central to the philosophies of [[Laozi]], [[Zeno of Elea]], [[Zhuang Zhou|Zhuangzi]], [[Heraclitus]], [[Bhartrhari]], [[Meister Eckhart]], [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegel]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]], and [[G.K. Chesterton]], among many others. Søren Kierkegaard, for example, writes in the ''[[Philosophical Fragments]]'' that:
<blockquote>But one must not think ill of the paradox, for the paradox is the passion of thought, and the thinker without the paradox is like the lover without passion: a mediocre fellow. But the ultimate potentiation of every passion is always to will its own downfall, and so it is also the ultimate passion of the understanding to will the collision, although in one way or another the collision must become its downfall. This, then, is the ultimate paradox of thought: to want to discover something that thought itself cannot think.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kierkegaard |first=Søren |editor1-first=Howard V. |editor1-last=Hong |editor2-first=Edna H. |editor2-last=Hong |title=Philosophical Fragments |year=1844 |page=37 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kuMoXUAaEr0C&pg=PA37 |publisher=Princeton University Press |publication-date=1985 |isbn=9780691020365}}</ref></blockquote>

==In medicine==

A [[paradoxical reaction]] to a [[drug]] is the opposite of what one would expect, such as becoming agitated by a [[sedative]] or sedated by a [[stimulant]]. Some are common and are used regularly in medicine, such as the use of stimulants such as [[Adderall]] and [[Ritalin]] in the treatment of [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (also known as ADHD), while others are rare and can be dangerous as they are not expected, such as severe agitation from a [[benzodiazepine]].<ref>{{cite journal |vauthors=Wilson MP, Pepper D, Currier GW, Holloman GH, Feifel D |title=The Psychopharmacology of Agitation: Consensus Statement of the American Association for Emergency Psychiatry Project BETA Psychopharmacology Workgroup |journal=Western Journal of Emergency Medicine |volume=13 |issue=1 |pages=26–34 |date=February 2012 |doi=10.5811/westjem.2011.9.6866 |doi-access=free |pmc=3298219 |pmid=22461918}}</ref>
