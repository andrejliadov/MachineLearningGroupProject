'''Process thinking''', also known as "the process", is a [[philosophy]] that emphasizes preparation and hard work over consideration of outcomes or results, and is particularly popular in professional sports.<ref name="GQ">St. John, Warren [https://www.gq.com/story/coach-nick-saban-alabama-maniac Nick Saban: Sympathy for the Devil] ''GQ Magazine''. January 4, 2016</ref> Practitioners of process thinking focus on the [[present]] instead of [[past]] events or [[future]] outcomes, and believe that all actions one takes in life, regardless of how trivial they may seem, affect the desired outcome.<ref name="Burke">{{cite book |last=Burke |first=Monte |authorlink=Monte Burke |date=2015 |title=Saban: The Making of a Coach}}</ref> The philosophy was popularized by [[American football]] coach [[Nick Saban]].<ref>Feloni, Richard [http://www.businessinsider.com/nick-saban-strategy-for-success-2014-5 The Simple Strategy Alabama Coach Nick Saban Used To Create A College Football Dynasty] ''Business Insider''.

==History==

The step-by-step mechanism of process thinking is a prominent part of cognitive behavioral thinking, which was developed by psychiatrist [[Aaron Beck]].<ref name="Burke" /> In the 1960s, Beck developed [[Cognitive behavioral therapy|a therapy]] which relies on the idea that thoughts affect feelings, and that good mental habits are systematically built up one step at a time.<ref>Layard, Richard and David M.

{{rquote|right|''Don’t think about winning the SEC Championship. Don’t think about the national championship. Think about what you needed to do in this drill, on this play, in this moment. That’s the process: Let’s think about what we can do today, the task at hand.''|Nick Saban<ref name="RH">{{cite book |last=Holiday |first=Ryan |authorlink=Ryan Holiday |date=2015 |title=The Obstacle Is The Way}}</ref>}}

Nick Saban formulated process thinking as it pertains to [[American football]] with the help of [[psychiatry]] [[professor]] Lionel Rosen while Saban was the head coach at [[Michigan State University]].<ref name="GQ" /><ref name="Observer">Holiday, Ryan [http://observer.com/2015/12/heres-the-strategy-elite-athletes-follow-to-perform-at-the-highest-level/ Here’s the Strategy Elite Athletes Follow to Perform at the Highest Level] ''New York Observer''. January 5, 2016</ref> Saban and Rosen broke down complicated tasks like football games—and entire seasons—down into smaller, more manageable pieces. Rosen emphasized that the average football play lasts only seven seconds so coaches and players should concentrate only on those seconds, take a rest between plays, then do it all over again.<ref name="Burke" />

During his time with [[Louisiana State University|LSU]], the [[Miami Dolphins]], and later the [[University of Alabama]], Saban refined this systematic approach and extended it to include all aspects of managing a football program, which he calls "the process."<ref>Burke, Monte [https://www.forbes.com/sites/monteburke/2015/08/04/9-leadership-lessons-from-nick-saban/2/ 9 Leadership Lessons From Nick Saban] ''Forbes''. January 5, 2016</ref> A key element of Saban's process, often stylized "The Process", is clearly defined expectations for his players not only on the field, but also academically and personally (including a dress code), which are monitored year-round.<ref name="GQ" /><ref>O'Keefe, Brian [http://fortune.com/2012/09/07/leadership-lessons-from-alabama-football-coach-nick-saban/ Leadership lessons from Alabama football coach Nick Saban] ''Fortune''. January 5, 2016</ref>

Nick Saban's Process featured in [[Ryan Holiday]]'s ''[[The Obstacle Is the Way]]'', where it drew comparisons to [[Stoicism|Stoic philosophy]].<ref name="RH" /><ref>Dooley, Roger [https://www.forbes.com/sites/rogerdooley/2014/06/04/the-obstacle-is-the-way/ The Obstacle Is The Way] ''Forbes''.

Saban has led his teams to numerous conference championships and six [[BCS National Championship Game|national championships]], five of them with Alabama and one with LSU.<ref>Schlabach, Mark [http://espn.go.com/college-football/story/_/id/14239090/jimmy-sexton-college-football-power-broker-scenes How Jimmy Sexton became college football's ultimate power broker] ''ESPN''. January 5, 2016</ref> Much of the credit for Saban's sustained success has been given to the Process.<ref name="Observer" />

Other coaches, players and general managers such as Head Coach of the [[Chicago Bears]] [[John Fox (American football)|John Fox]], [[Texas A&M Aggies Football]] coach [[Jimbo Fisher]] and [[University of Texas]] head basketball coach [[Shaka Smart]] have also asked their teams to “follow the process.”<ref>Miller, Kerry [http://bleacherreport.com/articles/2598455-the-shaka-smart-effect-on-full-display-in-texas-epic-upset-over-unc The Shaka Smart Effect on Full Display in Texas' Epic Upset over UNC] ''Bleacher Report''.
