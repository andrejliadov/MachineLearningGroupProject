An '''unusual unit of measurement''' is a [[unit of measurement]] that does not form part of a coherent [[systems of measurement|system of measurement]], especially because its exact quantity may not be well known or because it may be an inconvenient multiple or fraction of a base unit.

This definition is not exact since it includes units such as the week or the [[light-year]], which are quite "usual" in the sense that they are often used but which can be "unusual" if taken out of their common context, as demonstrated by the [[FFF system|furlong-firkin-fortnight (FFF)]] system of units.

Many of the unusual units of measurements listed here are colloquial measurements, units devised to compare a measurement to common and familiar objects.

==Length==
===Rack unit===
[[File:Server rack rail dimensions.svg|thumb|upright|A typical section of rack rail, showing rack unit distribution.]]
{{Main|Rack unit}}
One rack unit (U) is {{convert|1.75|in|2}} and is used to measure rack-mountable audiovisual, computing and industrial equipment. Rack units are typically denoted without a space between the number of units and the 'U'. Thus a 4U [[server (computing)|server]] enclosure (case) is {{convert|7|in|1|spell=in}} high, or more practically, built to occupy a vertical space seven inches high, with sufficient clearance to allow movement of adjacent hardware.

===Hand===
{{main|Hand (unit)}}
The '''hand''' is a non-[[SI]] unit of length equal to exactly {{convert|4|in|mm|1}}. It is normally used to measure the height of horses in some English-speaking countries, including Australia,<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060826125716/http://www.equestrian.org.au/site/equestrian/national/downloads/content/attachments/rules/02%20Mch-Nat%20Measuring%20Rules.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=26 August 2006 |title=Equestrian Federation of Australia National Measuring Scheme Effective from 1 January 2002 and amended in March 2002 |author=<!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--> |date=March 2002 |website=www.equestrian.org.au/ |publisher=Equestrian Federation of Australia |access-date=27 February 2014}}</ref> Canada, the United Kingdom, Ireland and the United States.

===Light-nanosecond===
The light-nanosecond is defined as exactly 29.9792458 [[centimetre|cm]]. It was popularized in [[information technology]] as a unit of distance by [[Grace Hopper]] as the distance which a photon could travel in one billionth of a second (roughly 30 [[centimetre|cm]] or one [[foot (unit)|foot]]): "The [[speed of light]] is one foot per nanosecond." In her speaking engagements, she was well known for passing out light-nanoseconds of wire to the audience, and contrasting it with light-microseconds (a coil of wire 1,000 times as long) and light-picoseconds (the size of ground [[black pepper]]). Over the course of her life, she found many uses for this visual aid, including demonstrating the waste of sub-optimal programming, illustrating advances in computer speed,and simply giving young scientists and policy makers the ability to conceptualize the magnitude of very large and small numbers.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://cs-www.cs.yale.edu/homes/tap/Files/hopper-story.html |title=Rear Admiral Grace Murray Hopper|date=4 May 2006 |publisher=US Navy}}</ref><ref>[https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_692464 National Museum of American History: "Nanoseconds Associated with Grace Hopper" https://americanhistory.si.edu/collections/search/object/nmah_692464]</ref>

===Metric foot===
A [[metric foot]] (defined as 300&nbsp;mm, or about 11.8 inches) has been used occasionally in the UK<ref>{{cite web |  title=BBC TV Centre | website=History of Television Studios in London | url=http://www.tvstudiohistory.co.uk/tv%20centre%20history.htm | quote=Measurements are in metric feet (30cm)...}}</ref> but has never been an official unit.

===Horse===
{{main|Horse length}}
Horses are used to measure distances in [[horse racing]] – a ''horse length'' (shortened to merely a ''length'' when the context makes it obvious) equals roughly {{convert|8|ft|m|1|abbr=off|disp=or}}. Shorter distances are measured in fractions of a ''horse length''; also common are measurements of a full or fraction of a ''head'', a ''neck'', or a ''nose''.<ref>{{cite web | title=Horse Racing Spread Betting – Get Started | website=Spreadex | url=https://www.spreadex.com/sports/get-started/horse-racing-spread-betting/winning-distances/ | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref>

===Boat length===
In rowing races such as the [[Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race]], the margin of victory and of defeat is expressed in fractions and multiples of ''lengths''. The length of a [[Eight (rowing)|rowing eight]] is about {{convert|62|ft|m}}. A shorter distance is the ''[[Glossary of rowing terms#canvas|canvas]]'', which is the length of the covered part of the boat between the bow and the bow oarsman. The [[Racing Rules of Sailing]] also makes heavy use of boat lengths.

===Football field (length)===
<!--American football field (unit) redirects here. If you change the section heading please update the redirect
-->A football field is often used as a comparative measurement of length when talking about distances that may be hard to comprehend when stated in terms of standard units.

An [[American football field]] is usually understood to be {{convert|100|yd|m}} long, though it is technically {{convert|120|yd|m}} when including the two {{convert|10|yd|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} long end zones. The field is {{convert|160|ft|yd m|abbr=on}} wide.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://operations.nfl.com/the-rules/2015-nfl-rulebook#rule-1.-the-field|title=2015 NFL Rulebook}}</ref>

A [[Canadian football field]] is {{convert|65|yd|m|abbr=on}} wide and {{convert|150|yd|m|abbr=on}} long, including two {{convert|20|yd|m|adj=on|abbr=on}} long end zones.

Media in the UK also use the [[association football pitch|football pitch]] as a unit of length, although the area of the [[association football]] pitch is not fixed, but may vary within limits of {{convert|90|-|120|m|yd|abbr=on}} in length and {{convert|45|-|90|m|yd|abbr=on|sigfig=2}} in width. The usual size of a football pitch is {{convert|105|x|68|m|yd|abbr=on}}, the dimensions used for matches in the [[UEFA Champions League]].

===Block===
In most US cities, a [[city block]] is between {{convert|1/16|and|1/8|mi|m|abbr=on}}. In [[Manhattan]], the measurement "block" usually refers to a north–south block, which is  {{convert|1/20|mi|m|abbr=on}}. Sometimes people living in places (like Manhattan)  with a regularly spaced street grid will speak of ''long blocks'' and ''short blocks''. Within a typical large North American city, it is often only possible to travel along east–west and north–south streets, so travel distance between two points is often given in the number of blocks east–west plus the number north–south (known to mathematicians as the ''[[taxicab geometry|Manhattan Metric]]'').<ref>{{cite web |url=https://xlinux.nist.gov/dads/HTML/manhattanDistance.html|title=Manhattan distance}}</ref>

===The Earth's circumference===
The circumference of a [[great circle]] of the [[Earth]] (about {{convert|40000|km|mi nmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}) is often compared to large distances. For example, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end at the equator "would circle the Earth four and a half times".<ref>{{cite news |url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=950DE6D7153FF934A3575AC0A96F948260|title=Enough Burnt Sienna to Circle the Globe|date=7 September 1989}}</ref> According to [[World Geodetic System|WGS-84]], the circumference of a circle through the poles (twice the length of a [[meridian (geography)|meridian]]) is {{convert|40007862.917|m|yd}} and the length of the [[equator]] is {{convert|40075016.686|m|yd}}. Despite the fact that the difference (0.17%) between the two is insignificant at the low precision that these quantities are typically given to, it is nevertheless often specified as being at the equator.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

The definitions of both the [[nautical mile]] and the [[kilometre]] were originally derived from the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. The nautical mile was defined as a [[minute of arc]] of [[latitude]] measured along any meridian. A circle has 360 degrees, and each degree is 60 minutes, so the nautical mile was defined as {{frac|1|21,600}} of the Earth's circumference, or about 1,852.22 [[metre]]s. However, by international agreement, it is now defined to be exactly {{convert|1852|m|ft}}.

The metre was originally defined as {{frac|1|10,000,000}} of the distance from a pole to the equator, or as {{frac|1|40,000,000}} of the Earth's circumference as measured through the poles. This standard made the historical metre 0.0197% longer than the modern standard metre, which is calculated based on the distance covered by light in a vacuum in a set amount of time.

===Earth-to-Moon distance===
The distance between the Earth's and the Moon's surfaces is, on average, approximately {{convert|380000|km|mi|abbr=in|disp=or}}. This distance is sometimes used in the same manner as the circumference of the Earth; that is, one might say that a large number of objects laid end-to-end "would reach all the way to the Moon and back two-and-a-half times".

The abbreviation for the Earth-to-Moon distance is "LD" which stands for "[[Lunar distance (astronomy)|Lunar Distance]]", used in astronomy to express close approaches of Earth by [[minor planet]]s.

===Siriometer===
The [[siriometer]] is a rarely used astronomical measure equal to one million [[astronomical unit]]s, i.e., one million times the average distance between the Sun and Earth. This distance is equal to about 15.8&nbsp;[[light-year]]s, 149.6&nbsp;[[peta-|P]]m or 4.8&nbsp;[[parsec]]s, and is about twice the distance from Earth to the star [[Sirius]].<!--Google test prefers US spelling-->

===Hammer unit===

Most computer programs and games use meters as the base unit to represent length, but some don't. One of the most common units used in software, that is unusual elsewhere, is the Hammer unit, a unit of measurement used in Valve's Source engine.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dimensions|title=Distance - Valve Developer Community|access-date=2020-11-29|quote=Maps, architecture and prop models use a scale of 1 foot = 16 units.}}</ref> One Hammer unit is usually defined as a sixteenth of a foot (16 Hammer units = 1 foot). This means that one Hammer unit is equal to exactly 0.01905 meters, and one meter is equal to exactly 52.49344 Hammer units. Note that this scale is not rigidly enforced in all Source games; each game has its own rules of how big things are that slightly differ from this standard. Another program that can use a unit similar to Hammer units is 3DS Max.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://developer.valvesoftware.com/wiki/Dimensions |title=Distance - Valve Developer Community|access-date=2020-11-29|quote=Note: Hammer units are equal to 3DSMax's generic units.}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=https://knowledge.autodesk.com/support/3ds-max/learn-explore/caas/CloudHelp/cloudhelp/2019/ENU/3DSMax-Customizing/files/GUID-69E92759-6CD9-4663-B993-635D081853D2-htm.html |title=Units Setup Dialog - 3ds Max 2019 - Autodesk Knowledge Network|access-date=2020-11-29|quote=A Generic or “system” unit in 3ds Max is equal to one inch. You can treat it as an arbitrary unit of your own definition, unless your scene uses features that depend on real-world measurements, such as photometric lights, Use Real-World Scale for bitmaps, and so on.}}</ref>

==Area==
===Barn===
{{Main|Barn (unit)}}
One barn is 10<sup>−28</sup> square metres, about the cross-sectional area of a uranium nucleus. The name probably derives from early neutron-deflection experiments, when the uranium nucleus was described, and the phrases "big as a barn" and "hit a barn door" were used. Barn are typically used for [[Cross section (physics)|cross section]]s in nuclear and particle physics. Additional units include the microbarn (or "outhouse")<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.nuclearglossary.com/abcs/nuclearglossary_O.html#outhouse |title=An Exceptional Nuclear Glossary |publisher=Nuclearglossary.com |date=25 November 2006 |access-date=8 April 2011}}</ref> and the yoctobarn (or "shed").<ref name="Rowlett">{{cite web |author= Russ Rowlett |date= 1 September 2004 |title= Units: S |url= http://www.unc.edu/~rowlett/units/dictS.html |website= How Many?

===Brass===
One brass is {{convert|100|ft2|sigfig=3}} area (used in measurement of work done or to be done, such as plastering, painting, etc.). It is also equal, however, to {{convert|100|ft3|sigfig=3}} of estimated or supplied loose material, such as sand, gravel, rubble, etc. This unit is prevalent in construction industry in [[India]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://gardentia.net/chart/|title=Chart|website=gardentia.net|access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.business-standard.com/article/economy-policy/mumbai-builders-hit-sand-trap-110021200018_1.html|title=Mumbai builders hit sand trap|first=Sanjay|last=Jog|date=12 February 2010|access-date=1 May 2018|via=Business Standard|newspaper=Business Standard India}}</ref>

===Square===
The ''[[square (unit)|square]]'' is an [[Imperial units|Imperial unit]] of [[area]] that is used in the construction industry in North America,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.p1m.com/um.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20031018185707/http://www.p1m.com/um.htm|url-status=dead|archive-date=18 October 2003|title=Units of Measurements|date=18 October 2003|access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref> and was historically used in [[Australia]] by real estate agents. One square is equal to {{convert|100|sqft|m2|2|lk=on}}. A [[roof]]'s area may be calculated in square feet, then converted to squares.

===Cow's grass===
In Ireland, before the 19th century, a "cow's grass" was a measurement used by farmers to indicate the size of their fields. A cow's grass was equal to the amount of land that could produce enough grass to support a cow.<ref>{{cite book |last=Kelly|first=John|title=The Graves are Walking: The Great Famine and Saga of the Irish People|page=15|publisher=Henry Holt & Co.|date=2012}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|url=https://archive.org/details/lettersoncondit00fostgoog|title=Letters on the Condition of the People of Ireland|last=Foster|first=Thomas Campbell|date=1846|publisher=Chapman and Hall|language=en|quote=The land is not let by the acre, but by what is termed a "cow's grass" — so many "cows' grass" to a farm.

A variation called a "cow field"{{clarify|reason=How big is a cow field, in standard units?|date=April 2016}} is still often used in the [[Channel Islands]], particularly [[Guernsey]], where classified advertisements in the local newspaper (''[[Guernsey Press]]'') for land can be seen referring to "A plot of land measuring X cow fields." This is probably still used because an acre of land in Guernsey is rather unusual due to the small size of the island and therefore a cow-field is a more suitable unit of measurement.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}}

===Football field (area)===
[[File:Terrains de polo et de football (US compliant).svg|thumb|140px|On this schema, an association football field is used to help to conceptualize the size of a polo field.]]

An [[American football field]], including both end zones, is {{convert|360|by|160|ft|yd m|1|abbr=on}}, or {{convert|57600|sqft|m2}} ({{convert|0.535|ha|acre|disp=or}}). A [[Canadian football field]] is {{convert|65|yd|m}} wide and {{convert|110|yd|m}} long with end zones adding a combined {{convert|40|yd|m}} to the length, making it {{convert|87750|sqft|m2}} or {{convert|0.8215|ha|acre|abbr=on}}.

An [[Australian rules football playing field|Australian rules football field]] may be approximately {{convert|150|m|yd}} (or more) long goal to goal and {{convert|135|m|yd}} (or more) wide, although the field's elliptical nature reduces its area to a certain extent. A {{convert|150|by|135|m|yd|adj=on}} football field has an area of approximately {{convert|15900|m2|ha acre|abbr=on}}, twice the area of a Canadian football field and three times that of an American football field.

===Morgen===
{{Main|Morgen}}
A [[morgen]] ("morning" in Dutch and German) was approximately the amount of land tillable by one man behind an ox in the morning hours of a day. This was an official unit of measurement in South Africa until the 1970s, and was defined in November 2007 by the South African Law Society as having a conversion factor of 1 morgen = {{val|0.856532|u=hectare}}.<ref>{{cite web

===Countries, regions, and cities===
[[File:British Isles United Kingdom WA highlighted.svg|thumb|upright|Wales (red) in the UK (pink)]]
The area of a familiar country, state or city is often used as a unit of measure, especially in [[journalism]].

====Wales====
Equal to 20,779&nbsp;km<sup>2</sup> (8,023&nbsp;sq&nbsp;mi), the country of [[Wales]] is used in phrases such as "an area the size of Wales"<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-wales-46737277 |title=Why is Wales used as a unit of measurement? |newspaper=BBC News |access-date=22 January 2019|date=22 January 2019 |last1=Frampton |first1=Ben }}</ref> or "twice the area of Wales".<ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/4543070.stm|title=BBC NEWS – UK – Wales – South West Wales – Expat joins Falklands council}}</ref><ref>{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/5184332.stm|title=BBC NEWS – Science/Nature – Diary: The Amazon rainforest}}</ref> [[England]] is 6.275 times the size of Wales, and Scotland is roughly four times the size of Wales. [[Ireland]] is four times larger than Wales, and [[France]] is about twenty-five times larger.

In older British and Commonwealth atlases, it was common to show a known area at the same scale, and the usual area to show was either Wales for smaller scales, or Great Britain for larger areas.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

The British comedy show ''[[The Eleven O'Clock Show]]'' parodied the use of this measurement, by introducing a news article about an earthquake in Wales, stating that an area the size of Wales was affected. The Radio 4 programme ''More or Less'' introduced the idea of "kilowales"&nbsp;– an area 1,000 times the size of Wales. ''[[The Register]]'' introduced the nanowales (20.78 m<sup>2</sup>).<ref>{{cite web |last=Haines|first=Lester|title=So, what's the velocity of a sheep in a vacuum?|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/24/vulture_central_standards/?page=2|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131114110120/https://www.theregister.co.uk/2007/08/24/vulture_central_standards/?page=2|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 November 2013|website=The Register|date=24 August 2007|access-date=25 August 2015}}</ref>

====The United States====
In the United States the area of the smallest state, [[Rhode Island]] ({{convert|1545|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}); the largest of the contiguous 48 states, [[Texas]] ({{convert|268601|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}); and less commonly [[Alaska]] ({{convert|656425|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the largest of all 50 states, are used in a similar fashion. For example, [[Antarctica]]'s [[Larsen Ice Shelf|Larsen B ice shelf]] was approximately the size of Rhode Island until it broke up in 2002. Other areas may be described like this, too, like in the 1979 movie ''[[The China Syndrome]]'' when radiation is expected to contaminate "an area the size of [[Pennsylvania]]". 

The US [[Central Intelligence Agency]] uses [[Washington, D.C.]] ({{convert|61.4|sqmi|km2|disp=or|abbr=on}}) as a comparison for city-sized objects.{{Citation needed|date=March 2011}}

====Other countries====
In the Netherlands, its smallest province, [[Utrecht (province)|Utrecht]] ({{convert|1386|km2|sqmi|abbr=on|disp=or}}), is often used as a comparison for regions in general.

The country of [[Belgium]] ({{convert|30528|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) has also often been used when comparing areas, to the point where it has been regarded as a [[meme]]<ref>{{cite news|first=Chris |last=Edwards |title=Quizzical: this month, Chris Edwards tackles temperature extremes, the size of Belgium, categorising nations' development status, the hydrogen bombs dropped on Japan and the number of people who speak Scottish Gaelic |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3120/is_8_77/ai_n29198390/ |work=[[Geographical (magazine)|Geographical]] |date=August 2005 |access-date=20 May 2009 |url-status=dead |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110413081725/http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_hb3120/is_8_77/ai_n29198390/ |archive-date=13 April 2011 }}</ref> and where there is a [http://www.sizeofbelgium.com/ website] dedicated to notable areas which have been compared to that of Belgium.

The [[Isle of Wight]] ({{convert|380|km2|sqmi|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}), an island off the south coast of mainland [[England]], is commonly used to define smaller areas. It has sometimes been used in attempts to examine whether a certain amount of a given object or group would fit in a space its size; in 2018, it was estimated that approximately 2.6 billion people could fit on the Isle of Wight, at a population density of six people per square metre.<ref>{{cite web |last1=White |first1=Jamie |title=Would The World's Population Fit on the Isle of Wight? |url=https://iwradio.co.uk/2018/03/08/worlds-population-fit-isle-wight/ |website=[[Isle of Wight Radio]]|date=8 March 2018 }}</ref>

In [[Denmark]], the island of [[Bornholm]] (588 square kilometers) is often used to describe the size of an area.

In Germany, the [[Saarland]] ({{convert|2569.69|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) is often used to define areas.<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.welt.de/wissenschaft/article6452153/Das-Saarland-das-Vergleichsmass-vieler-Dinge.html|title=Größenordnungen: Das Saarland – das Vergleichsmaß vieler Dinge – DIE WELT|author=Marco Krefting|date=18 February 2010|newspaper=DIE WELT}}</ref>

In [[Brazil]], it is common to compare relatively small areas to the state of [[Sergipe]] ({{convert|21910.4|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}), the smallest in the country. Smaller areas are sometimes compared to the cities of [[São Paulo]] ({{convert|1521.11|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}) or [[Rio de Janeiro]] ({{convert|1221|km2|sqmi|disp=or|abbr=on}}).

==Volume==
<!-- Please keep these sorted in ascending order, smallest volume first -->

===Metric ounce===
A metric ounce is an approximation of the imperial ounce, US dry ounce, or US fluid ounce. These three customary units vary. However, the metric ounce is usually taken as 25 or 30&nbsp;ml when volume is being measured, or grams when mass is being measured.

The US [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) defines the "food labeling ounce" as 30&nbsp;ml, slightly larger than the 29.6&nbsp;ml [[fluid ounce]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2004/aprqtr/21cfr101.9.htm |title=Food and Drugs: FDA Food Labeling |date=1 April 2004 |publisher=[[US Government Printing Office]] |access-date=27 August 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204081321/http://edocket.access.gpo.gov/cfr_2004/aprqtr/21cfr101.9.htm |archive-date=4 February 2012 |url-status=dead }}<br/>For [[Nutrition facts label]]ing "a teaspoon means 5 milliliters (ml), a tablespoon means 15 ml, a cup means 240 ml, 1 fl oz means 30 ml, and 1 oz in weight means 28 g".</ref>

Several [[Dutch units of measurement]] have been replaced with informal metric equivalents, including the ''ons'' or ounce. It originally meant {{Fraction|1|16}} of a pound, or a little over 30 grams depending on which definition of the pound was used, but was redefined as 100 grams when the country metricated.<ref>[https://www.hollandexpatcenter.com/themes/personal---social-needs/dutch-conversions/]</ref>

===Shot===
{{Main|Shot glass}}
[[File:Three shotglasses.jpg|thumb|right|Three shot glasses of varying shape and size]]
The [[shot glass|shot]] is a liquid volume measure that varies from country to country and state to state depending on legislation. It is routinely used for measuring strong [[liquor]] or spirits when the amount served and consumed is smaller than the more common measures of alcoholic "drink" and "pint". There is a legally defined maximum size of a serving in some jurisdictions. The size of a "single" shot is {{convert|20|-|60|ml|abbr=on}}. The smaller "pony" shot is {{convert|20|-|30|ml|abbr=on}}.

===Board foot or super foot===
{{Main|Board foot}}
A board foot is a United States and Canadian unit of volume, used for lumber. It is equivalent to {{nowrap|1 inch × 1 foot × 1 foot}} ({{convert|144|cuin|0|disp=or|abbr=on}}). It is also found in the unit of density ''pounds per board foot''. In Australia and New Zealand the terms ''super foot'' or ''superficial foot'' were formerly used for this unit.

===Hoppus foot===
{{details|Hoppus}}
A system of measure for timber in the round (standing or felled), now largely superseded by the metric system except in measuring hardwoods in certain countries. Its purpose is to estimate the value of sawn timber in a log, by measuring the unsawn log and allowing for wastage in the mill. Following the so-called "quarter-girth formula" (the square of one quarter of the circumference in inches multiplied by {{frac|1|144}} of the length in feet), the notional log is four feet in circumference, one inch of which yields the hoppus board foot, 1 foot yields the hoppus foot, and 50 feet yields a hoppus ton. This translates to a hoppus foot being equal to {{convert|1.273|ft3|in3 m3}}. The hoppus board foot, when milled, yields about one [[board foot]]. The volume yielded by the quarter-girth formula is 78.54% of cubic measure (i.e. 1&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup> = 0.7854&nbsp;h&nbsp;ft; 1&nbsp;h&nbsp;ft = 1.273&nbsp;ft<sup>3</sup>).<ref name="forest mensuration">{{cite book |last= Husch |first= Bertram |author2=Thomas W.

===Cubic ton===
{{Main|Cubic ton}}
A cubic ton is an antiquated measure of volume, varying based on the commodity from about {{convert|16|to|45|ft3|m3|abbr=on}}. It is now only used for lumber, for which one cubic ton is equivalent to {{convert|40|ft3|m3|abbr=on}}.

===Cord and rick===
[[File:Cord of wood.jpg|thumb|A cord of wood]]
{{Main|Cord (unit)}}
The cord is a unit of measure of [[dry measure|dry volume]] used in Canada and the United States to measure [[firewood]] and [[pulpwood]]. A cord is the amount of wood that, when "ranked and well stowed" (arranged so pieces are aligned, parallel, touching and compact), occupies a volume of {{convert|128|cuft|m3|2}}.<ref>{{cite web |author=British Columbia Ministry of Forests and Range|title=Glossary of Forestry Terms in British Columbia|url=http://www.for.gov.bc.ca/hfd/library/documents/glossary/Glossary.pdf|access-date=4 September 2008}}</ref> This corresponds to a well-stacked woodpile, 4 feet deep by 4 feet high by 8 feet wide {{nowrap|(122 cm × 122&nbsp;cm × 244&nbsp;cm)}}, or any other arrangement of linear measurements that yields the same volume. A more unusual measurement for firewood is the "rick" or [[face cord]]. It is stacked {{convert|16|in|cm|sigfig=3}} deep with the other measurements kept the same as a cord, making it {{frac|3}} of a cord; however, regional variations mean that its precise definition is nonstandardized.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.ibiblio.org/units/dictR.html|title=Units: R|last=Rowlett|first=Russ|date=25 April 2002|website=How Many?

===Twenty-foot equivalent unit===
{{main|Twenty-foot equivalent unit}}
The twenty-foot equivalent unit is the volume of the smallest standard [[intermodal container|shipping container]]. It is equivalent to {{convert|1360|cuft|m3}}. Larger intermodal containers are commonly described in multiples of TEU, as are container ship capacities.

===Acre-foot===
{{Main|Acre-foot}}
An acre-foot is a unit of volume commonly used in the United States in reference to large-scale water resources, such as reservoirs, aqueducts, canals, sewer flow capacity, irrigation water<ref>{{cite web |title=NM OSE Glossary|url=http://www.ose.state.nm.us/water_info_glossary.html#A|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051114202301/http://www.ose.state.nm.us/water_info_glossary.html|url-status=dead|archive-date=14 November 2005|access-date=15 March 2014}}</ref> and river flows. It is defined by the volume of one acre of surface area to a depth of one foot. {{convert|43560|ft3|m3 USgal impgal|0|abbr=on}}.

===Casual units===
[[File:Olympic Swimming Pool - Fast Lane.JPG|thumb|An Olympic-size swimming pool holds over 2 acre-feet of water.]]
Many well-known objects are regularly used as casual units of volume. They include:

'''Double-decker bus'''. The approximate volume of a [[double-decker bus]], abbreviated to DDB, has been used informally to describe the size of hole created by a major sewer collapse. For example, a report might refer to "a 4 DDB hole".<ref>{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8wpnoExCJOcC|title=Sewers : Repair and Renovation|publisher= Butterworth-Heinemann|author=Geoffrey F Read, Ian Vickridge eds.|date=24 December 1996|access-date=29 June 2016|isbn=978-0080541129}}</ref>

'''Olympic-size swimming pool.''' For larger volumes of liquid, one measure commonly used in the media in many countries is the [[Olympic-size swimming pool]].<ref>Paul Hudson: [https://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/paulhudson/2010/06/3rd-anniversary-of-july-2007-f.shtml 3rd anniversary of June 2007 floods], showing a storm water storage tank "half the size of an Olympic swimming pool"</ref> A {{convert|50|×|25|m|abbr=on}} Olympic swimming pool, built to the FR3 minimum depth of {{convert|2|m|ft|1}} would hold {{convert|2500|m3|l impgal USgal acre·ft|abbr=on}}.

'''Royal Albert Hall'''. The [[Royal Albert Hall]], a large concert hall, is sometimes used as a unit of volume in the UK, for example when referring to volumes of rubbish placed in landfill.<ref>p [http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7949761.stm "Landfill tax 'costing homes £30'", BBC News website]</ref> It is famously used in the line "Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall." in [[The Beatles]] song "[[A Day in the Life]]".<ref name="Origins">{{cite web |url=http://www.applecorp.com/aditl/origins.htm |title=A Day in the Life&nbsp;– An Indepth Analysis&nbsp;– The Origins of the Song |access-date=18 September 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20080419020720/http://www.applecorp.com/aditl/origins.htm |archive-date= 19 April 2008}}</ref> The volume of the auditorium is between 3 and 3.5 million cubic feet (between 85,000 and 99,000 cubic metres).<ref>{{cite book

[[File:Sydney(from air) V2.jpg|thumb|Sydney Harbour ([[Port Jackson]]).]]
'''Sydney Harbour'''. A unit of volume used in Australia for water. One Sydney Harbour is the amount of water in [[Port Jackson|Sydney Harbour]]: approximately 562 gigalitres (562,000,000 cubic metres, or 0.562 of a cubic [[kilometre]]); or in terms of the more unusual measures above, about 357 [[#Melbourne Cricket Ground|Melbourne Cricket Grounds]], 238,000 [[#Olympic-size swimming pool|Olympic Swimming pools]], or 476,000 [[#Acre-foot|acre-feet]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/The-secret-harbour-uncovered/2004/12/10/1102625541209.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160116134156/http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/The-secret-harbour-uncovered/2004/12/10/1102625541209.html|title=The secret harbour uncovered|archive-date=16 January 2016|date=11 December 2004}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url=http://media.bom.gov.au/social/blog/39/when-dam-size-matters/ |title=When dam size matters |author= Australian Bureau of Meteorology |access-date=4 September 2014}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |author=NSW Irrigators' Council (NSWIC)|title=Useful Water Comparisons|url=http://www.nswic.org.au/pdf/fact_sheets/USEFUL%20WATER%20COMPARISONS.pdf|access-date=4 September 2014}}</ref>

==Flow rate==
===Miner's inch===
{{main|Miner's inch}}
The volume of water which flows in one unit of time through an orifice one inch square or in diameter. The size of the unit varies from one place to another.

==Mass==
===Bag of cement and bag mix===
The mass of an old bag of [[Portland cement|cement]] was one [[hundredweight]] ~ 112&nbsp;lb, approximately 50&nbsp;kg. The amount of material that, say, an aircraft could carry into the air is often visualised as the number of bags of cement that it could lift. In the concrete and petroleum industry, however, a bag of cement is defined as 94 pounds (~ 42.6&nbsp;kg), because it has an apparent volume close to {{convert|1|cuft|L}}.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.cement.org/tech/faq_unit_weights.asp|title=Frequently Asked Questions, unit weights|publisher=Portland Cement Association|date=2011|access-date=15 February 2011}}</ref> When [[ready-mix concrete]] is specified, a "bag mix" unit is used as if the batching company mixes 5 literal bags of cement per cubic yard (or cubic metre) when a "5 bag mix" is ordered.{{Citation needed|date=April 2020|reason==cubic yard is significantly different from cubic meter}}

===Grave===
In 1793, the French term "[[grave (mass)|grave]]" (from "gravity") was suggested as the base unit of mass for the metric system. In 1795, however, the name "[[kilogramme]]" was adopted instead.

===Jupiter===
[[File:Jupiter,_image_taken_by_NASA%27s_Hubble_Space_Telescope,_June_2019_-_Edited.jpg|thumb|upright|Jupiter]]
When reporting on the masses of [[extrasolar planet]]s, astronomers often discuss them in terms of multiples of [[Jupiter mass|Jupiter's mass]] ({{Jupiter mass}} = 1.9 {{e|27}}&nbsp;kg).<ref>{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/extrasolar-planet-types-100214.html |title=Out There: A Strange Zoo of Other Worlds |work=Space.com |date=14 February 2010}}</ref>
For example, "Astronomers recently discovered a planet outside our Solar System with a mass of approximately 3 Jupiters." Furthermore, the mass of Jupiter is nearly equal to one thousandth of the mass of the Sun.

===Sun===
[[Solar mass]] ({{Solar mass}} = {{val|2.0|e=30|u=kg}}) is also often used in astronomy when talking about masses of stars or galaxies; for example, [[Alpha Centauri A]] has the mass of 1.1 suns, and the [[Milky Way]] has a mass of approximately {{Solar mass|6{{e|11}}}}.

Solar mass also has a special use when estimating orbital periods and distances of 2 bodies using [[Kepler's laws]]: ''a<sup>3</sup> = M<sub>total</sub>T<sup>2</sup>'', where ''a'' is length of [[semi-major axis]] in [[astronomical unit|AU]], ''T'' is orbital period in years and ''M<sub>total</sub>'' is the combined mass of objects in {{Solar mass}}. In case of planet orbiting a star, ''M<sub>total</sub>'' can be approximated to mean the mass of the central object. More specifically in the case of Sun and Earth the numbers reduce to ''M<sub>total</sub>'' ~ 1, ''a'' ~ 1 and ''T'' ~ 1.

==Time==
<!-- Please keep these sorted in ascending order -->

===Light-distance===
[[George Gamow]] discussed measurements of time such as the "light-mile" and "light-foot", the time taken for light to travel the specified unit distance, defined by "reversing the procedure" used in defining a light-year.<ref>{{cite book |author=George Gamow|title=One Two Three ... Infinity: Facts and Speculations of Science|location=New York|publisher=Viking|date=1947|page=77|title-link=One Two Three ... Infinity}}</ref> A light-foot is roughly one [[nanosecond]].

===Shake===
In [[nuclear chain reaction|nuclear engineering]] and astrophysics contexts, the [[shake (time)|shake]] is sometimes used as a conveniently short period of time. 1&nbsp;shake is defined as 10&nbsp;[[nanosecond]]s.<ref>{{cite web|title=The Pathogenesis and Therapy of Combined Radiation Injury |url=http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/CR06_1.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070106134035/http://www.afrri.usuhs.mil/www/outreach/pdf/CR06_1.pdf |url-status=dead |archive-date=6 January 2007  |publisher=Defense Threat Reduction Agency |access-date=12 November 2006 }}</ref>

===Jiffy===
In [[computing]], the [[jiffy (time)|jiffy]] is the duration of one tick of the system timer [[interrupt]]. Typically, this time is 0.01&nbsp;seconds, though in some earlier systems (such as the [[Commodore International|Commodore]] [[8-bit]] machines) the jiffy was defined as {{frac|1|60}} of a second, roughly equal to the vertical refresh period (i.e. the field rate) on [[NTSC]] video hardware (and the [[utility frequency|period of AC electric power]] in North America).

===Microfortnight===
One unit derived from the [[FFF system]] of units is the microfortnight, one millionth of the fundamental time unit of FFF, which equals 1.2096&nbsp;seconds. This is a fairly representative example of "[[computer humor|hacker humor]]",<ref>{{cite web |url=http://catb.org/jargon/html/M/microfortnight.html|title=microfortnight}}</ref> and is occasionally used in operating systems; for example, the [[OpenVMS]] TIMEPROMPTWAIT parameter is measured in microfortnights.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.faqs.org/faqs/dec-faq/vms/part3 |title=OpenVMS Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ), Part 3/11 |at=4.1.1.1.4 EXE$GL_TODR |date=11 April 2005 |access-date=10 March 2009}}</ref>

===Sidereal day===
The [[sidereal day]] is based on the Earth's rotation rate relative to fixed stars, rather than the Sun. A sidereal day is approximately 23 hours, 56 minutes, 4.0905 SI seconds.

===Decimal time systems===
{{main|Decimal time}}
[[File:Decimal_Time_Clock.jpeg|thumb|Decimal Time clock reading 2.50 DT equivalent to 6 AM standard time]]
The measurement of time is unique in SI in that while the [[second]] is the base unit, and measurements of time smaller than a second use prefixed units smaller than a second (e.g. microsecond, nanosecond, etc.), measurements larger than a second instead use traditional divisions, including the [[sexagesimal]]-based ''[[minute]]'' and ''[[hour]]'' as well as the less regular ''[[day]]'' and ''[[year]]'' units.

SI allows for the use of larger prefixed units based on the second, a system known as [[metric time]], but this is seldom used, since the number of seconds in a day (86,400 or, [[leap second|in rare cases, 86,401]]) negate one of the metric system's primary advantages: easy conversion by multiplying or dividing by powers of ten.

There have been numerous proposals and usage of [[decimal time]], most of which were based on the day as the base unit, such that the number of units between any two events that happen at the same time of day would be equal to the number of days between them multiplied by some integer power of ten. In dynastic China, the [[kè]] was a unit that represented {{frac|1|100}} of a day (it has since been refined to {{frac|1|96}} of a day, or 15 minutes). In France, a decimal time system in place from 1793 to 1805 divided the day into 10 hours, each divided into 100 minutes, in turn each divided into 100 seconds; the [[French Republican Calendar]] further extended this by assembling days into ten-day "weeks".

[[Ordinal date]]s and [[Julian day]]s, the latter of which has seen use in astronomy as it is not subject to [[leap year]] complications) allow for the expression of a decimal portion of the day.<ref>See, for instance, the [http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh current Mean Julian Day] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606205531/http://tycho.usno.navy.mil/cgi-bin/daterdnm.sh |date=6 June 2011 }}, precise to 6 decimal place, from the [[United States Naval Observatory]].</ref> In the mid-1960s, to defeat the advantage of the recently introduced computers for the then popular rally racing in the Midwest, competition lag times in a few events were given in centids ({{frac|1|100}} day, 864 seconds, 14.4 minutes), millids ({{frac|1|1,000}} day, 86.4 seconds) and centims ({{frac|1|100}} minute, 0.6 seconds) the latter two looking and sounding a bit like the related units of minutes and seconds.{{verification needed|date=December 2020}} Decimal time proposals are frequently used in fiction, often in [[futurism|futuristic]] works.

In addition to decimal time, there also exist [[binary clock]]s and [[hexadecimal time]].

===Sol===
{{main|Sol (day on Mars)}}
{{further|Timekeeping on Mars}}
The United States-based [[NASA]], when conducting missions to the planet [[Mars (planet)|Mars]], has typically used a time of day system calibrated to the mean solar day on that planet (known as a "sol"), training those involved on those missions to acclimate to that length of day, which is 88,775 SI seconds, or 2,375 seconds (about 39 minutes) longer than the mean solar day on Earth. NASA's Martian timekeeping system (instead of breaking down the sol into 25×53×67 or 25×67×53 SI second divisions) slows down clocks so that the 24-hour day is stretched to the length of that on Mars; Martian hours, minutes and seconds are thus 2.75% longer than their SI-compatible counterparts.<ref>{{cite web |url= http://mars.nasa.gov/mer/spotlight/spirit/a3_20040108.html |title=Watchmaker With Time to Lose |website=JPL Mars Exploration Rovers |year=2014 |access-date=22 January 2015}}</ref><ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.space.com/20243-mars-rover-curiosity-discoveries-grotzinger.html |title=After Finding Mars Was Habitable, Curiosity Keeps Roving |first=Nola Taylor |last=Redd |website=space.com |date=18 March 2013 |access-date=22 January 2015}}</ref>

The [[Darian calendar]] is an arrangement of sols into a Martian year. It maintains a seven-sol week (retaining Sunday through Saturday naming customs), with four weeks to a month and 24 months to a Martian year, which contains 668 or 669 sols depending on [[leap year]]s. The last Saturday of every six months is skipped over in the Darian calendar.

===Dog year===
[[File:10 yr old Mastiff.JPG|thumb|A 10-year-old [[Neapolitan Mastiff]]]]
There are two diametrically opposed definitions of the ''dog year'', primarily used to approximate the equivalent age of [[dog]]s and other animals with similar life spans. Both are based upon a [[List of common misconceptions|popular myth]] regarding the [[aging in dogs|aging of dogs]] that states that a dog ages seven years in the time it takes a human to age one year.
*One seventh of a year, or approximately 52 days.<ref name=dogyear>[https://web.archive.org/web/20110612143355/http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/43339983/ns/today-today_pets_and_animals Multimillionaire pooch dies at age 12 (84 in dog years)]. ''MSNBC.com''. Retrieved 12 June 2011.</ref> When this definition is used, a standard calendar year is known as a "human year".
*A standard (365-day) calendar year of a dog's life, whereas a "human year" is the period of a dog's (or other animal's) life that is claimed to be equivalent to a year of a human being's life (or seven calendar years).<ref>{{cite web

In fact, the aging of a dog varies by breed (larger breeds tend to have shorter lifespans than small and medium-sized breeds); dogs also develop faster and have longer adulthoods relative to their total life span than humans. Most dogs are sexually mature by 1 year old, which corresponds to perhaps 13 years old in humans. [[Giant dog breed]]s and [[bulldog]]s tend to have the strongest linear correspondence to human aging, with longer adolescences and shorter overall lifespans; such breeds typically age about nine times as fast as humans throughout their lives.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090610035254/http://www.pets911.com/hosted/buffalo/puppy/article.php?num=11045|archive-date=10 June 2009|title=Sexual Maturity&nbsp;— Spay and Neuter|publisher=Buffalo.com|access-date=22 October 2008}}</ref>

===Galactic year===
{{Main|Galactic year}}
The galactic year, GY, is the time it takes the solar system to revolve once around the galactic core, approximately 250 million years ([[megaannum]] or "Ma"). It is a convenient unit for long-term measurements. For example, oceans appeared on Earth after 4&nbsp;GY, life is detectable at 5&nbsp;GY, and multicellular organisms first appeared at 15&nbsp;GY. The [[age of the Earth]] is estimated at about 20&nbsp;GY.<ref>{{cite web |title=Geologic Time Galactic |url=http://www.vendian.org/mncharity/dir3/geologic_time_galactic/ |publisher=vendian.org |access-date=19 December 2006}}</ref> This use of GY is not to be confused with Gyr for [[gigayear]] or Gy for [[Gray (unit)]].

===KerMetric time===
KerMetric time is a concept that divides the 24-hour day into 100 equal parts called Kermits. Each Kermit is equivalent to 14.4 minutes; the derivative math of (24 hours × 60 minutes/hour)/100. More precise time can be counted by dividing by 1000 or even 10000. The name Kermit came from a combination of the surname of the president of the [[National Research Council (Canada)|National Research Council]] in 1983 (Dr. [[Larkin Kerwin]]). The original working model of KerMetric time as conceived by W. Thayer of NRC was assembled by the designated Clock Construction Team of John Phillips, Ron Hawkins, Les Moore and Willie Thayer in 1983.<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://www.csgnetwork.com/timemetricdispcalc3.html|title=KerMetric Time Display Calculator}}</ref>

=== Moment ===
A [[Moment (time)|moment]] was a [[Middle Ages|medieval]] unit of time. The movement of a shadow on a [[sundial]] covered 40 moments in a [[Solar time|solar hour]]. An hour in this case meant one twelfth of the period between [[sunrise]] and [[sunset]]. The length of a [[Solar time|solar hour]] depended on the length of the day, which in turn varied with the [[season]], so the length of a [[Moment (time)|moment]] in modern [[second]]s was not fixed, but on [[average]], a [[Moment (time)|moment]] corresponded to 90 seconds.

===Thirds, fourths===

The term "[[minute]]" usually means {{frac|1|60}} of an [[hour]], coming from "a minute division of an hour". The term "[[second]]" comes from "the [[Second#Sexagesimal divisions of calendar time and day|second minute division]] of an hour", as it is {{frac|1|60}} of a minute, or {{frac|1|60}} of {{frac|1|60}} of an hour. While usually sub-second units are represented with [[International System of Units|SI]] prefixes on the second (e.g., [[millisecond]]s), this system can be extrapolated further, such that a "Third" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a second, and a "Fourth" would mean {{frac|1|60}} of a third, etc. These units are occasionally used in astronomy to denote angles.<ref>{{Cite journal |last=Herschel |first=William |s2cid=186209747 |year=1785 |title=Catalogue of Double Stars |journal=[[Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society|Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London]] |volume=75 |pages=40–126 |jstor=106749 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1785.0006 }}</ref>

==Angular measure==
===Furman===
The Furman is a unit of angular measure equal to {{frac|1|65,536}} of a circle, or just under 20 [[arcsecond]]s. It is named for Alan T. Furman, the American mathematician who adapted the [[CORDIC]] algorithm for 16-bit fixed-point arithmetic sometime around 1980.<ref>{{cite journal |last=Furman |first=Alan T. |title=The Cordic Algorithm for Fixed-Point Polar Geometry |url=http://www.forth.org/fd/FD-V04N1.pdf |journal=FORTH Dimensions |volume=4 |pages=14–15 |access-date=16 January 2009 }}</ref> 16 bits give a resolution of 2<sup>16</sup> = 65,536 distinct angles.

===Binary degree, binary radian, brad===
{{See also|Binary scaling#Binary angles}}
A related unit of angular measure equal to {{Frac|1|256}} of a circle, represented by 8 bits, has found some use in machinery control where fine precision is not required, most notably crankshaft and camshaft position in [[engine control unit|internal combustion engine controllers]], and in video game programming. There is no consensus as to its name, but it has been called the 8-Bit Furman, the Small Furman, the Furboy and more recently, the miFurman, (milli-binary-Furman). These units are convenient because they form cycles: for the 8-bit unit, the value overflows from 255 to 0 when a full circle has been traversed, so binary addition and subtraction work as expected. Measures are often made using a [[Gray code]], which is trivially converted into more conventional notation. Its value is equivalent to [[Turn (angle)#Tau proposals|Tau]]/256 radians, or about 0.0245436926 radians.

===Grade ''(also grad, gradian, gon)''===
{{Main|Grad (angle)}}
Coordinates were measured in grades on official French terrestrial ordnance charts from the French revolution well into the 20th century. 1 grade ''(or in modern symbology 1 gon)'' = 0.9° or 0.01 right angle. One advantage of this measure is that the distance between latitude lines 0.01 gon apart at the equator is almost exactly 1 kilometer ''(and would be exactly 1&nbsp;km if the original definition of 1 meter = {{frac|1|10,000}} quarter-meridian had been adhered to)''. One disadvantage is that common angles like 30° and 60° are expressed by fractional values (33{{frac|1|3}} and 66{{frac|2|3}} respectively) so this "decimal" unit failed to displace the "sexagesimal" units equilateral-vertex – degree – minute – second invented by Babylonian astronomers.{{POV statement|date=October 2019}}

===Mils, strecks===
[[File:mil estimation.jpg|thumb|upright|Estimating mils by hand]]
''Mils'' and ''strecks'' are small units of angle used by various military organizations for range estimation and translating map coordinates used for directing artillery fire.<ref>{{cite book |title=Collins Concise Dictionary of the English Language|date=1982|isbn=978-0-00-433091-4|editor-first=William T|editor-last=Macleod}}</ref> The exact size varies between different organizations: there are 6400 NATO mils per [[Turn (angle)|turn]] (1 NATO mil&nbsp;= 0.982&nbsp;[[milliradian|mrad]]), or 6000 Warsaw pact mils per turn (1 Warsaw pact mil&nbsp;= 1.047&nbsp;mrad). In the Swedish military, there are 6300 strecks per turn (1 streck&nbsp;= 0.997&nbsp;mrad).

===MERU (Milli Earth Rate Unit)===
The '''MERU''', or Milli Earth Rate Unit, is an angular velocity equal to 1/1000 of Earth's [[sidereal time|rotation rate]]. It was introduced by MIT's Instrumentation Laboratories (now [[Draper Labs]]) to measure the performance of [[inertial navigation system]]s.<ref>{{cite book|last=Brown|first=Russel H|title=Inertial Instrument System for Aerial Surveying|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=009p-dfd-kgC&pg=PA14|series=U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper|volume=1390|year=1987|publisher=U.S. Government Printing Office|page=14}}</ref> One MERU = {{gaps|7.292|115| e=-8 | u=[[radians]] per second}}<ref name=IERS>{{cite web|url=http://hpiers.obspm.fr/eop-pc/models/constants.html|title=USEFUL CONSTANTS|website=Hpiers.obspm.fr|access-date=22 September 2018}}</ref> or about 0.2625 milliradians/hour.

==Energy==
===Electronvolt mass===
{{Main|Electronvolt#Mass}}
It is common in particle physics, where mass and energy are often interchanged, to use eV/c<sup>2</sup>, where eV (electronvolt) is the kinetic energy of an [[electron]] accelerated over one [[volt]] ({{val|1.6|e=-19}} [[joule]]s), c is the speed of light in a vacuum (from E = mc<sup>2</sup>). This definition is useful for a [[linear particle accelerator]] when accelerating electrons.

::1 [[Dalton (unit)|Da]]&nbsp;= 931.46 MeV/c<sup>2</sup>

More frequently the system of natural units where c=1, and eV was used as a unit of mass.{{Citation needed|reason=What system(s) of natural units?|date=October 2019}}

===Gasoline gallon equivalent===
{{Main|Gasoline gallon equivalent}}
In 2011 the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] introduced the ''gallon gasoline equivalent'' as a unit of energy because their research showed most U.S. citizens do not understand the standard units. The gallon gasoline equivalent is defined as 33.7 kWh,<ref name=EPAstudy10>{{cite web |url=http://www.epa.gov/fueleconomy/label/420r10909.pdf|title=Environmental Protection Agency Fuel Economy Label – Final Report|authors=Office of Transportation and Air Quality, EPA, and [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]], Us DoT|publisher=[[US Environmental Protection Agency]]|date=September 2010|access-date=20 February 2011}}</ref> or about 1.213{{e|8}} joules.

Efficiency / fuel economy can be given as [[miles per gallon gasoline equivalent]].

===Tons of TNT equivalent===
{{Main|TNT equivalent|Richter magnitude scale#Examples}}
The energy of various amounts of the explosive [[trinitrotoluene|TNT]] (kiloton, megaton, gigaton) is often used as a unit of [[explosion]] energy, and sometimes of asteroid impacts and violent explosive volcanic eruptions. One ton of TNT produces 4.184{{e|9}} joules, or (by arbitrary definition) exactly {{10^|9}} [[calorie|thermochemical calories]] (approximately 3.964{{e|6}} BTU). This definition is only loosely based on the actual physical properties of TNT.

===Hiroshima bomb and Halifax explosion===
[[File:Atomic cloud over Hiroshima - NARA 542192 - Edit.jpg|thumb|upright|Hiroshima bomb explosion]]
[[File:Halifax Explosion blast cloud.jpg|thumb|upright|Halifax explosion]]
{{Main|Moment magnitude scale#Nuclear explosions}}
The energy released by the [[Little Boy|Hiroshima bomb]] explosion (about 15&nbsp;kt TNT equivalent, or 6{{e|13}}&nbsp;J) is often used by [[geologist]]s as a unit when describing the energy of [[earthquake]]s, [[volcanic eruption]]s, and [[impact event|asteroid impact]]s.

Prior to the detonation of the Hiroshima bomb, the size of the [[Halifax Explosion]] (about 3&nbsp;kt TNT equivalent, or 1.26{{e|13}}&nbsp;J), was the standard for this type of relative measurement. Each explosion had been the largest known artificial detonation to date.<ref name=TimeDisaster>{{cite book |title=Time: Disasters that Shook the World|publisher=Time Home Entertainment|location=New York City|date=2012|page=56|isbn=978-1-60320-247-3}}</ref>

===Quad===
A [[Quad (unit)|quad]] is a unit of energy equal to {{10^|15}}&nbsp;[[British thermal unit|BTUs]], or approximately 1.055{{e|18}}&nbsp;J (slightly over one exajoule).  It is suitably large to quantify energy usage by nations or by the planet as whole using everyday numbers.  For example, in 2004, US energy consumption was about 100 Q/year, while demand worldwide was about 400 Q/year.<ref>{{cite journal |title=Basic Choices and Constraints on Long-Term Energy Supplies|date=July 2004 |journal=Physics Today|volume=57|issue=7|pages=47–52|doi=10.1063/1.1784302|last1=Weisz|first1=Paul B.|bibcode=2004PhT....57g..47W|doi-access=free}}</ref>

===Foe===
A [[Foe (unit)|foe]] is a unit of energy equal to {{10^|44}}&nbsp;[[joule]]s (≈9.478{{e|40}} [[British thermal unit|BTU]]) that was coined by physicist Gerry Brown of [[Stony Brook University]]. To measure the staggeringly immense amount of energy produced by a [[supernova]], specialists occasionally use the "foe", an acronym derived from the phrase [ten to the power of] '''f'''ifty-'''o'''ne '''e'''rgs, or {{10^|51}}&nbsp;[[erg]]s. This unit of measure is convenient because a supernova typically releases about one foe of observable energy in a very short period of time (which can be measured in seconds).

==Other metric-compatible scales==
===Power: Ton of refrigeration===
{{Main|Ton of refrigeration}}
The rate at which heat is removed by melting {{convert|1|ST|kg|spell=in}} of ice in 24 hours is called a ton of refrigeration, or even a ton of cooling. This unit of refrigeration capacity came from the days when large blocks of ice were used for cooling, and is still used to describe the heat-removal capabilities of refrigerators and chillers today. One ton of refrigeration is exactly equal to 12,000 BTU/h, or 3.517&nbsp;kW.

===Flow: Amazon River===
The volume of discharge of the [[Amazon River]] sometimes used to describe large volumes of water flow such as ocean currents. The unit is equivalent to 216,000&nbsp;[[Cubic metre per second|m<sup>3</sup>/s]].<ref>{{cite web | title=Amazon River – Facts, History, Animals, & Map | website=Encyclopedia Britannica | url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Amazon-River | access-date=10 August 2019}}.</ref>

=== Flow: Sverdrup ===
One [[Sverdrup]] (Sv) is equal to 1,000,000 cubic metres per second (264,000,000 USgal/s). It is used almost exclusively in [[oceanography]] to measure the volumetric rate of transport of [[ocean current]]s.

===Energy intensity===
The [[langley (unit)|langley]] (symbol Ly) is used to measure solar radiation or [[insolation]]. It is equal to one thermochemical [[calorie]] per square centimetre (4.184{{e|4}}&nbsp;J/m<sup>2</sup> or ≈3.684 BTU/sq&nbsp;ft) and was named after [[Samuel Pierpont Langley]]. Its symbol should not be confused with that for the light-year, ly.

===Kinematic viscosity===
One of the few [[centimetre gram second system of units|CGS]] units to see wider use, one [[kinematic viscosity|stokes]] (symbol S or St) is a unit of [[kinematics|kinematic]] [[viscosity]], defined as 1&nbsp;cm<sup>2</sup>/s, i.e., 10<sup>−4</sup>&nbsp;m<sup>2</sup>/s (≈1.08×10<sup>−3</sup>&nbsp;sq&nbsp;ft/s).

===Angular velocity===
'''MERU''' (Milli Earth Rate Unit), an [[angular velocity]] equal to {{frac|1|1000}} of Earth's rotation rate: 1 MERU = 0.015 degrees/hour ≈ 0.072921 microradian/second. Sometimes used to measure the angular drift rate of an [[inertial navigation system]].<ref>''Fundamentals of High Accuracy Inertial Navigation,'' Averil B. Chatfield, [American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics], 1997, p.32</ref>

===Electromagnetic flux===
In [[radio astronomy]], the unit of [[flux|electromagnetic flux]] is the [[jansky]] (symbol Jy), equivalent to 10<sup>−26</sup> [[watt]]s per square metre per [[hertz]] (= 10<sup>−26</sup>&nbsp;kg/s<sup>2</sup> in base units, about 8.8×10<sup>−31</sup>&nbsp;BTU/ft<sup>2</sup>). It is named after the pioneering radio astronomer [[Karl Guthe Jansky|Karl Jansky]]. The brightest natural radio sources have flux densities of the order of one to one hundred jansky.

===Metre of water equivalent===
{{main|Meter water equivalent}}
A material-dependent unit used in [[nuclear physics|nuclear]] and [[particle physics]] and engineering to measure the thickness of shielding, for example around a [[nuclear reactor technology|nuclear reactor]], [[particle accelerator]], or [[particle detector|radiation or particle detector]]. 1 mwe of a material is the thickness of that material that provides the equivalent shielding of one metre (≈39.4&nbsp;in) of water.

This unit is commonly used in underground science to express the extent to which the [[overburden]] (usually rock) shields an underground space or laboratory from [[cosmic ray]]s. The actual thickness of overburden through which cosmic rays must traverse to reach the underground space varies as a function of direction due to the shape of the overburden, which may be a mountain, or a flat plain, or something more complex like a cliff side. To express the depth of an underground space in mwe (or kmwe for deep sites) as a single number, the convention is to use the depth beneath a flat overburden at [[sea level]] that gives the same overall cosmic ray [[muon]] flux in the underground location.

===Strontium unit: radiation dose===
The [[strontium unit]], formerly known as the Sunshine Unit (symbol S.U.), is a unit of biological contamination by radioactive substances (specifically [[strontium-90]]). It is equal to one [[Curie (unit)|picocurie]] of Sr-90 per [[gram]] of body [[calcium]]. Since about 2% of the human body mass is calcium, and Sr-90 has a [[half-life]] of 28.78 years, releasing 6.697+2.282 [[electronvolt|MeV]] per disintegration, this works out to about 1.065{{e|-12}}&nbsp;[[gray (unit)|gray]]s per second. The permissible body burden was established at 1,000&nbsp;S.U.

===Banana equivalent dose===
[[File:Bananen Frucht.jpg|thumb|right|upright=.5|A banana contains [[naturally occurring radioactive material]] in the form of [[potassium-40]]]]
Bananas, like most organic material, naturally contain a certain amount of radioactive isotopes—even in the absence of any artificial pollution or contamination. The [[banana equivalent dose]], defined as the additional dose a person will absorb from eating one banana, expresses the severity of exposure to radiation, such as resulting from nuclear weapons or medical procedures, in terms that would make sense to most people. This is approximately 78 nano[[sievert]]s – in informal publications one often sees this estimate rounded up to 0.1 μSv.

===Molar mass of cellulose===
In the [[pulp and paper]] industry, [[molar mass]] is traditionally measured with a method where the [[intrinsic viscosity]] (dL/g) of the pulp sample is measured in cupriethylenediamine (Cuen). The intrinsic viscosity [η] is related to the weight-average molar mass (in [[atomic mass unit|dalton]]s) by the [[Mark-Houwink equation]]: [η] = 0.070 M<sub>w</sub><sup>0.70</sup>.<ref>{{Cite journal |doi = 10.1016/j.chroma.2013.01.038|pmid = 23398992|title = A re-investigation of the Mark–Houwink–Sakurada parameters for cellulose in Cuen: A study based on size-exclusion chromatography combined with multi-angle light scattering and viscometry|journal = Journal of Chromatography A|volume = 1281|pages = 32–37|year = 2013|last1 = Kes|first1 = Mürşide|last2 = Christensen|first2 = Bjørn E.}}</ref> However, it is typical to cite [η] values directly in dL/g, as the "viscosity" of the cellulose, confusingly as it is not a viscosity.

===Iodine, bromine and kappa number===
In measuring unsaturation in fatty acids, the traditional method is the [[iodine value|iodine number]]. Iodine adds stoichiometrically to double bonds, so their amount is reported in grams of iodine spent per 100 grams of oil. The standard unit is a dimensionless stoichiometry ratio of moles double bonds to moles fatty acid. A similar quantity, [[bromine number]], is used in gasoline analysis.

In pulp and paper industry, a similar [[kappa number]] is used to measure how much [[bleaching]] a pulp requires. [[Potassium permanganate]] is added to react with the unsaturated compounds (lignin and uronic acids) in the pulp and back-titrated. Originally with [[Bleaching of wood pulp#Chlorine and hypochlorite|chlorine bleaching]] the required quantity of [[chlorine]] could be then calculated, although modern methods use multiple stages. Since the oxidizable compounds are not exclusively lignin and the partially pulped lignin does not have a single stoichiometry, the relation between the kappa number and the precise [[amount of substance|amount]] of lignin is inexact.

=== Temperature: Gas Mark ===
[[Gas Mark]] is a temperature scale, predominantly found on British [[oven]]s, that scales [[linear scale|linearly]] with [[Celsius]] above 135°C (Gas Mark 1) and scales with the [[logarithmic scale|log]] of Celsius below 135°C.

==Demography and epidemiology==
[[Demography]] and quantitative [[epidemiology]] are [[statistical]] fields that deal with [[count data|counts]] or proportions of people, or rates of change in these. [[Count data|Counts]] and proportions are technically [[dimensionless quantity|dimensionless]], and so have no [[units of measurement]], although identifiers such as "people", "births", "infections" and the like are used for clarity. Rates of change are [[rate (mathematics)|counts per unit of time]] and strictly have inverse time dimensions (per unit of time). In [[demography#Common Rates and Ratios|demography]] and epidemiology expressions such as [[Mortality rate|"deaths per year"]] are used to clarify what is being measured.

[[Prevalence]], a common measure in [[epidemiology]] is strictly a type of [[denominator data]], a dimensionless ratio or proportion. [[Prevalence]] may be expressed as a fraction, a percentage or as the number of cases per 1,000, 10,000 or 100,000 in the population of interest.

===Micromort===
{{Main|Micromort}}
A micromort is a unit of [[risk]] measuring a one-in-a-million [[probability]] of [[death]] (from [[micro-]] and [[Wikt:mortality|mortality]]). Micromorts can be used to measure riskiness of various day-to-day activities. A microprobability is a one-in-a million chance of some event; thus a micromort is the microprobability of death. For example, smoking 1.4 cigarettes increases one's death risk by one micromort, as does traveling {{convert|230|mi|abbr=in|order=flip}} by car.

===Numbers of people: Stadium capacities===
[[File:AFL Grand Final 2010 on the Melbourne Cricket Ground.jpg|thumb|To make large numbers of people comprehensible, the capacity of large stadiums is often used. Here the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (MCG) is in the process of filling with 100,016 spectators on [[2010 AFL Grand Final|AFL grand final day in 2010]].]]
The large numbers of people involved in [[demography]] are often difficult to comprehend. A useful visualisation tool is the audience capacity of large sports stadiums (often about 100,000). Often the capacity of the largest stadium in a region serves as a unit for a large number of people. For example, Uruguay's [[Estadio Centenario]] is often used in [[Uruguay]],<ref>{{cite web | title=Ahora la borrachera es "previa" a la fiesta | website=elpais.com.uy | date=15 October 2009 | url=http://www.elpais.com.uy/091011/pciuda-447246/ciudades/ahora-la-borrachera-es-previa-a-la-fiesta | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015002051/http://www.elpais.com.uy/091011/pciuda-447246/ciudades/ahora-la-borrachera-es-previa-a-la-fiesta | archive-date=15 October 2009 | url-status=dead | language=es | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | title=The unemployed would fill three and a half Centennial Stadiums (Spanish) | website=LARED21 | date=7 November 2002 | url=http://www.lr21.com.uy/comunidad/97129-los-desocupados-colmarian-tres-y-medio-estadios-centenarios | language=es | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> while in parts of the United States, [[Michigan Stadium]] is used in this manner.{{Citation needed|date=February 2013}} In Australia, the capacity of the [[Melbourne Cricket Ground]] (about 100,000) is often cited in this manner.

===Struck by lightning===
"Struck by lightning" is often used to put highly infrequent events into perspective.  Among the ~300 million people in the United States, there are ~300 people struck by lightning annually and ~30 killed, making a lightning strike a one in a million event and a death a one in ten million event; given a mean life expectancy of slightly over 75 years, the chances of an American ever being struck in their lifetime is about 1 in 13,000.<ref>{{cite web|author=National Weather Service|title=NWS Lightning Safety Home Page|url=http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|access-date=27 February 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180308162344/http://www.lightningsafety.noaa.gov/odds.shtml|archive-date=8 March 2018|url-status=dead}}</ref>
For example: "A person is about 15 times more likely to be struck by lightning in a given year than to be killed by a stranger with a diagnosis of schizophrenia or chronic psychosis".<ref>{{cite web |title=Gun Violence and Mental Illness|url=https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/26341929-gun-violence-and-mental-illness?from_search=true|access-date=27 February 2018}}</ref>

==Computer and information science==
The growth of computing has necessitated the creation of many new units, several of which are based on unusual foundations.

===Data volume===
[[File:Print vs. bytes.jpg|thumb|A CD-ROM can easily store the entirety of a paper encyclopedia's words and images, plus audio and video clips]]
Volume or capacity of data is often compared to works of literature or large collections of writing. Popular units include bibles, encyclopaediae, phone books, [[complete works of Shakespeare|the complete works of Shakespeare]], and the [[Library of Congress]].

When the [[Compact Disc]] began to be used as a [[data storage device]], the [[CD-ROM]], journalists had to compare the disc capacity (650 [[megabyte]]s) to something everyone could imagine. The Christian [[Bible]] was often used. The [[Authorized King James Version|King James Version of the Bible]] in uncompressed plain 8-bit text contains about 4.5 million characters,<ref>{{cite book |url=http://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/10|title=The Bible, Old and New Testaments, King James Version – Project Gutenberg|access-date=7 December 2011}}</ref> so a [[CD-ROM]] can store about 150 [[Bible]]s.

The print version of the ''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' is another common data volume metric. It contains approximately 300 million characters,<ref>{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/02/08/business/44-million-words-strong-britannica-to-join-internet.html?pagewanted=all&src=pm|author=John Markoff|title=44 Million Words Strong, Britannica to Join Internet|access-date=7 December 2011|date=8 February 1994|work=The New York Times}}</ref> so two copies would fit onto a [[CD-ROM]] and still have 50 megabytes (or about 11 bibles) left over.

The term ''Library of Congress'' is often used. It refers to the US [[Library of Congress]]. Information researchers have estimated that the entire print collections of the [[Library of Congress]] represent roughly 10 [[terabyte]]s of uncompressed [[text file|textual data]].<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www2.sims.berkeley.edu/research/projects/how-much-info/how-much-info.pdf#page=110|author=Peter Lyman|author2=Hal R. Varian|title=How Much Information?|access-date=29 November 2011|date=18 October 2000}}</ref>

===Nibble===
A measure of quantity of data or information, the "[[nibble]]" (sometimes spelled "nybble" or "nybl") is normally equal to 4 bits, or one half of the common 8-bit byte. The nibble is used to describe the amount of memory used to store a digit of a number stored in [[binary-coded decimal]] format, or to represent a single hexadecimal digit. Less commonly, 'nibble' may be used for any contiguous portion of a byte of specified length, e.g. "6-bit nibble"; this usage is most likely to be encountered in connection with a hardware architecture in which the word length is not a multiple of 8, such as older 36-bit minicomputers.

===FLOPS===
{{Main|FLOPS}}
In [[computing]], FLOPS (''FL''oating point ''O''perations ''P''er ''S''econd) is a measure of a computer's computing power. It is also common to see measurements of kilo, mega, giga, and teraFLOPS.

It is also used to compare the performance of computers in practice.<ref>{{cite web |title=TOP500 LIST November 2018 |url=https://top500.org/lists/2018/11/ |website=Top 500 |publisher=Top 500 |access-date=21 January 2019}}</ref>

=== BogoMips ===
{{Main|BogoMips}}
A measure to determine the [[Central processing unit|CPU]] speed. It was invented by [[Linus Torvalds]] and is nowadays present on every [[Linux]] operating system. However, it is not a meaningful measure to assess the actual [[Central processing unit|CPU]] performance.

===KLOC: computer program length===
A computer programming expression, the [[source lines of code|K-LOC]] or KLOC, pronounced ''kay-lok'', standing for "kilo-[[source lines of code|lines of code]]", i.e., thousand lines of code. The unit was used, especially by [[IBM]] managers,<ref>{{cite web | title=Triumph of the Nerds: The Transcripts, Part II | website=PBS | url=https://www.pbs.org/nerds/part2.html | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref> to express the amount of work required to develop a piece of software. Given that estimates of 20 lines of functional code per day per programmer were often used, it is apparent that 1 K-LOC could take one programmer as long as 50 working days, or 10 working weeks. This measure is no longer in widespread use because different computer languages require different numbers of lines to achieve the same result (occasionally the measure "assembly equivalent lines of code" is used, with appropriate conversion factors from the language actually used to assembly language).

Error rates in programming are also measured in "Errors per K-LOC", which is called the ''defect density''. NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center#Software Assurance Technology Center|SATC]] is one of the few organisations to claim zero defects in a large (>500K-LOC) project, for the space shuttle software.

An alternative measurement was defined by [[Pegasus Mail]] author [[David Harris (software developer)|David Harris]]: the "WaP" is equivalent to 71,500 lines of program code, because that number of lines is the length of one edition of [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]''.<ref>{{cite web | title=April 2017 – "How many WaPs is that?" | website=Pegasus Mail and Mercury | date=30 November 2011 | url=http://www.pmail.com/devnews_archive.htm | access-date=10 August 2019}}</ref>

===Ticks===
The "tick" is the amount of time between timer [[interrupt]]s generated by the timer circuit of a CPU. The amount of time is processor-dependent.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Laplante |first1=Phillip A. |last2=Ovaska |first2=Seppo J. |title=Real-Time Systems Design and Analysis: Tools for the Practitioner |date=22 November 2011 |publisher=John Wiley & Sons |isbn=9780470768648 |page=122 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Ez6-aSfbqtsC&pg=PA122|language=en}}</ref><ref>{{cite book |last1=Bovet |first1=Daniel P. |last2=Cesati |first2=Marco |title=Understanding the Linux Kernel: From I/O Ports to Process Management |date=17 November 2005 |publisher=O'Reilly Media, Inc. |isbn=9780596554910 |page=245 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h0lltXyJ8aIC&pg=PT245 |language=en}}</ref>

==Purchasing power parity==
===Big Mac Index===
{{Main|Big Mac Index}}
[[File:Big Mac hamburger.jpg|thumb|A McDonald's Big Mac hamburger, as advertised in the United States]]
''[[The Economist]]''<nowiki>'</nowiki>s [[Big Mac Index]] compares the [[purchasing power parity]] of countries in terms of the cost of a [[Big Mac]] hamburger.<ref>{{cite news |title=Big MacCurrencies |work=The Economist|date=9 April 1998 |url=http://www.economist.com/finance/displaystory.cfm?story_id=E1_TVJRVJ}}</ref> This was felt to be a good measure of the prices of a basket of commodities in the local economy including labour, rent, meat, bread, cardboard, advertising, lettuce, etc.

A similar system used in the UK is the '[[Mars bar]]'. Tables of prices in Mars bars have intermittently appeared in newspapers over the last 20 years, usually to illustrate changes in wages or prices over time without the confusion caused by inflation.<ref name="ft_inflation">[http://www.ft.com/cms/s/9f128868-68b4-11da-bd30-0000779e2340.html Mars Bar], Nico Colchester Fellowship, FT.com (Financial Times website).

===Coffee/latte===
The cost of a cup of [[coffee]] (or sometimes latte) from a coffeehouse or cafe is often used as a measurement of two vectors: the relatively diminutive expense of something frivolous, versus the power of collective contributions towards something important. Campaigns implore something to the effect of, "for the cost of a cup of coffee, you can help stamp out diabetes."<ref>{{Citation

===Centipawn===
[[Chess]] software frequently uses centipawns internally or externally as a unit measuring how strong each player's situation position is, and hence also by how much one player is beating the other, and how strong a possible move is.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://chess-db.com/public/research/qualityofplay.html|title=Chess Play Quality Index|website=chess-db.com|access-date=1 May 2018}}</ref> 100 centipawns = [[chess piece relative value|the value of]] 1 pawn – more specifically, something like the average value of the pawns at the start of the game, as the actual value of pawns depends on their position. Loss of a pawn will therefore typically lose that player 100 centipawns. The centipawn is often used for comparing possible moves, as in a given position, chess software will often rate the better of two moves within a few centipawns of each other.

===Garn===
The garn is NASA's unit of measure for symptoms resulting from [[space adaptation syndrome]], the response of the human body to weightlessness in space, named after US Senator [[Jake Garn]], who became exceptionally spacesick during an orbital flight in 1985. If an astronaut is completely incapacitated by space adaptation syndrome, he or she is under the effect of one garn of symptoms.<ref>{{cite web | title=Robert E.

===Mother Cow Index===
Formerly used in real estate transactions in the American Southwest, it was the number of pregnant cows an acre of a given plot of land could support. It acted as a proxy for the agricultural quality, natural resource availability, and arability of a parcel of land.<ref>{{cite document | title=Country Gentleman. v.75 1910. | date=2 January 2019 | hdl=2027/mdp.39015043511578 }}</ref>

===Nines===
{{Main|Nine (purity)}}
[[Image:Four nines fine gold.jpeg|thumb|upright|{{convert|1|ozt|g|lk=in}} of four nines fine gold (999,9)]]
Numbers very close to, but below one are often expressed in "[[nines (engineering)|nines]]" (N – not to be confused with the unit [[newton (unit)|newton]]), that is in the number of nines following the decimal separator in writing the number in question. For example, "three nines" or "3N" indicates 0.999 or 99.9%, "four nines five" or "4N5" is the expression for the number 0.99995 or 99.995%.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://vikashazrati.wordpress.com/2008/10/24/truth-about-availabilit/|title=The Truth About Availability: What does 99.99% mean?|website=c0nnexx10n: C0nnect1ng L1fe w1th Techn010gy}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=McGachie|first1=Richard O. |last2=Bradley|first2=Anne Grace |title=Precious metals|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=KOMYAAAAIAAJ&pg=PA262|volume=4|year=1981|publisher=Pergamon|isbn=978-0-08-025369-5|page=262}}</ref><ref>{{cite book|title=PVD for Microelectronics: Sputter Desposition to Semiconductor Manufacturing|year=1998|page=[https://books.google.com/books?id=hmvtBE_7i00C&pg=PA387 387]}}<!-- NOTE: reference has typo, writing 99.9995% as "four-nines-five" while it is actually *five* nines five. --></ref>

Typical areas of usage are:
*The [[reliability engineering|reliability]] of computer systems, that is the ratio of [[uptime]] to the sum of [[uptime]] and [[downtime]]. "Five nines" reliability in a continuously operated system means an average [[downtime]] of no more than approximately five minutes per year. (See [[high availability]] for a chart.)
*The [[Nine (purity)|purity]] of materials, such as gases and metals.

===Pain===
[[File:OuchFlintGoodrichShot1941.jpg|thumb|A woman wincing in pain]]
{{See also|Pain scale|Dolorimeter|Pain|Nociception}}
The dol (from the [[Latin language|Latin]] word for pain, ''dolor'') is a [[unit of measurement]] for [[pain]]. [[James D. Hardy]], [[Herbert G. Wolff]], and [[Helen Goodell]] of [[Cornell University]] proposed the unit based on their studies of pain during the 1940s and 1950s. They defined one dol to equal to "just noticeable differences" ([[jnd]]'s) in pain. The unit never came into widespread use and other methods are now used to assess the level of pain experienced by patients.

The Schmidt sting pain index and Starr sting pain index are [[pain scale]]s rating the relative pain caused by different [[hymenoptera]]n stings. Schmidt has refined his [[Schmidt Sting Pain Index]] (scaled from 1 to 4) with extensive anecdotal experience, culminating in a paper published in 1990 which classifies the stings of 78 species and 41 genera of Hymenoptera. The [[Starr sting pain scale]] uses the same 1-to-4 scaling.

===Pepper heat===
====ASTA pungency unit====
The ASTA ([[American Spice Trade Association]]) [[piquance|pungency]] unit is based on a scientific method of measuring chili pepper "heat". The technique utilizes [[high-performance liquid chromatography]] to identify and measure the concentrations of the various compounds that produce a heat sensation. Scoville units are roughly {{frac|1|15}} the size of pungency units while measuring [[capsaicin]], so a rough conversion is to multiply pungency by 15 to obtain Scoville heat units.<ref name="tainter">{{cite book |last= Tainter |first= Donna R.|author2=Anthony T. Grenis |date= 2001 |title= Spices and Seasonings |publisher= Wiley-IEEE |isbn= 978-0-471-35575-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfp4b3F0598C&pg=PA30|page=30}} — "Interlab variation [for the original Scoville scale] could be as high as ±50%. However, labs that run these procedures could generate reasonably repeatable results."</ref>

====Scoville heat unit====
[[File:Madame Jeanette and other chillies.jpg|thumb|Chili peppers.]]
The [[Scoville scale]] is a measure of the hotness of a [[chili pepper]]. It is the degree of dilution in sugar water of a specific chili pepper extract when a panel of 5 tasters can no longer detect its "heat".<ref name="what_is_scoville_scale">[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/how-hot-is-that-pepper-how-scientists-measure-spiciness-884380/?no-ist]. Retrieved 20 June 2016.</ref> Pure [[capsaicin]] (the chemical responsible for the "heat") has 16&nbsp;million Scoville heat units.

===Proof: alcohol concentration===
[[File:Bacardi 151 bottle.jpg|thumb|upright|A (nearly empty) bottle of 151° proof rum]]
Up to the 20th century, alcoholic spirits were assessed in the UK by mixing with gunpowder and testing the mixture to see whether it would still burn; spirit that just passed the test was said to be at 100° [[alcoholic proof|proof]]. The UK now uses percentage [[alcohol by volume]] at 20&nbsp;°C (68&nbsp;°F), where spirit at 100° proof is approximately 57.15%&nbsp;ABV; the US uses a "proof number" of twice the ABV at 60&nbsp;°F (15.5&nbsp;°C).{{sfn|Regan|2003|p=}}{{sfn|Berry|1998|p=}}

===Savart===
The [[Savart]] is an 18th-century unit for measuring the frequency ratio of two sounds. It is equal to {{frac|1|1000}} of a [[Decade (log scale)|decade]]. Still used in some programs, but considered too rough for most purposes.{{clarify|date=January 2019}} [[Cent (music)|Cent]] is preferred.

===Telecommunications traffic volume===
{{Main|Erlang (unit)}}
The erlang, named after A. K. Erlang, as a [[Dimensionless quantity|dimensionless unit]] is used in [[telephony]] as a statistical measure of the offered intensity of [[telecommunication]]s [[traffic]] on a group of resources. Traffic of one erlang refers to a single [[resource (project management)|resource]] being in continuous use, or two [[channel (communications)|channel]]s being at fifty percent use, and so on, [[wikt:pro rata|pro rata]]. Much telecommunications management and forecasting software uses this.

===Waffle House Index ===
{{Main|Waffle House Index}}
[[Waffle House Index]] is used by the [[Federal Emergency Management Agency]] (FEMA) to determine the impact of a storm and the likely scale of assistance required for disaster recovery. The measure is based on the reputation of the [[Waffle House]] restaurant chain for staying open during extreme weather. This term was coined by FEMA Administrator [[Craig Fugate]].

===X-ray intensity===
{{Main|Crab (unit)}}
The crab is defined as the intensity of X-rays emitted from the [[Crab Nebula]] at a given photon energy up to 30 kilo[[electronvolts]]. The Crab Nebula is often used for calibration of X-ray telescopes. For measuring the X-ray intensity of a less energetic source, the milliCrab (mCrab) may be used.

One crab is approximately 24 pW/m<sup>2</sup>.
