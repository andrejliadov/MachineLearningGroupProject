'''ASPERA''' (or '''AStroParticle European Research Area''') is a network of national government agencies responsible for coordinating and funding national research efforts in [[Astroparticle Physics]].

==Members==
ASPERA comprises the following agencies: [[NFWO|FNRS]] (Belgium), [[NFWO|FWO]] (Belgium), <span title="Ministry of Education, Youth and Sport">[[MEYS]]</span> (Czech Republic), [[Commissariat à l'Énergie Atomique|CEA]] (France), [[CNRS]] (France), [[BMBF]] (Germany), [[PTDESY]] (Germany), [[DEMOKRITOS]] (Greece), [[INFN]] (Italy), [[AMOLF|FOM]] (Netherlands), [[Fundação para a Ciência e Tecnologia|FCT]] (Portugal), [[FECYT]] (Spain), [[Ministry of Education, Social Policy and Sport of Spain|MEC]] (Spain), [[Swiss National Science Foundation|SNF]] (Switzerland), [[Vetenskapsrådet|VR]] (Sweden), [[Science and Technology Facilities Council|STFC]] (United Kingdom) and the European organization [[CERN]].

==History==
ASPERA started in July 2006 and is funded by the [[European Commission]] over a three-year period.

ASPERA has come about through the existence of [[ApPEC]] (Astroparticle Physics European Coordination/Consortium)<ref>{{cite web|url=http://193.146.122.114:8888/appec/history.html|title=APPEC - History|date=7 December 2013|work=APPEC|accessdate=7 December 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131211195332/http://193.146.122.114:8888/appec/history.html|archive-date=11 December 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref> which was founded in 2001 when six European scientific agencies took the initiative to coordinate and encourage [[Astroparticle Physics]] in Europe.

==Roadmap==
One of the most important achievements of ASPERA was to produce a common European Roadmap<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.aspera-eu.org/images/stories/roadmap/aspera_roadmap.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110721083959/http://www.aspera-eu.org/images/stories/roadmap/aspera_roadmap.pdf|url-status=dead|archive-date=21 July 2011|date=21 July 2011}}</ref><ref>https://www.appec.org/wp-content/uploads/Documents/Docs-from-old-site/2011_ASPERA_roadmap_update.pdf</ref> for the future, in the field of astroparticle physics.

Published in September 2008 in Brussels, the Roadmap presents the "Magnificent Seven", which are the Seven large infrastructures expected in the next 10 years to answer some of the most exciting questions about the Universe such as: What is [[dark matter]]? What is the [[origin of cosmic rays]]? What is the role of violent cosmic processes? Can we detect [[gravitational waves]]?

* CTA, The [[Cherenkov Telescope Array]], a large array of Cherenkov Telescopes for detection of cosmic high-energy [[gamma rays]]
* [[KM3NeT]], a cubic kilometre-scale [[neutrino telescope]] in the [[Mediterranean Sea]]
* Ton-scale detectors for dark matter searches, such as [[European Underground Rare Event Calorimeter Array|EURECA]]
* A ton-scale detector for the determination of the fundamental nature and mass of [[neutrinos]]
* A Megaton-scale detector for [[proton decay]]’s search, neutrino astrophysics & investigation of neutrino properties
* A large array for the detection of charged [[cosmic rays]]
* A third-generation underground [[gravitational antenna]]
