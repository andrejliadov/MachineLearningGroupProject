The '''National Society of Black Physicists''' (NSBP) was established in the United States in 1977<ref name=aa1>{{cite book|title=African Americans in Science|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=W0nw5KTJJygC&pg=PA525|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-998-6|pages=524–526}}</ref> to promote the professional well-being of [[African Diaspora]] [[physicist]]s and physics students within the international scientific community and the world community at large.

==History==
A group of involved physicists met at [[Fisk University]] in 1973 to honor several well known [[African-American]] physicists.  In 1977, the Society was established at [[Morgan State University]], with its founding co-chairs being [[Walter E. Massey]] and James Davenport.<ref name=aa1/>

==Activities==
The organization holds its annual conference in February. More recently, it has jointly held these conferences with the [[National Society of Hispanic Physicists]]. Attendance at these conferences is upwards of 500 persons, drawing people from all over the world, from Kenya to California.   This conference has a cutting-edge scientific program as well as a student professional development program that includes mentor-protégé match-making and a recruiting fair.

Throughout its history NSBP has had an active interest in physics related activities outside of the [[United States]]. Twenty years ago under the leadership of the late Nobel Laureate, [[Abdus Salam]],  and the late Charles Brown, several NSBP members organized the Edward Bouchet-Abdus Salam Institute (EBASI).  EBASI  (1) provides mechanisms for synergistic scientific and technical collaborations between African and American physical scientists, engineers, and technologists, (2) enhances the impact of science and technology on the sustainable development of the countries on the African continent, and (3) increases the technical manpower pool working in Africa today by facilitating the training of Ph.D. students from African universities.  More recently, through a program funded by the [[Kellogg Foundation]] NSBP will assist [[South Africa]] in its efforts to increase the number of Black astronomers and astrophysicists and to build  capacity in the field.

The organization offers scholarships, some in conjunction with [[Black Enterprise]] magazine, and conducts outreach programs aimed at students from kindergarten through high school.<ref name=aa1/>
