'''Moseley's law''' is an [[empirical law]] concerning the characteristic [[X-ray#Physics|x-rays]] emitted by [[atom]]s. The law had been  discovered and published by the English physicist [[Henry Moseley]] in 1913-1914.<ref name="Mose1913" /><ref name="Mose1914" /> Until Moseley's work, "atomic number" was merely an element's place in the periodic table and was not known to be associated with any measurable physical quantity.<ref>e.g. {{Cite book |first=J. |last=Mehra |first2=H. |last2=Rechenberg |title=The historical development of quantum theory |publisher=Springer-Verlag |location=New York |year=1982 |others=Vol. 1, Part 1 |pages=193–196 |isbn=3-540-90642-8 }}</ref> In brief, the law states that the square root of the frequency of the emitted x-ray is approximately proportional to the [[atomic number]].<math>\surd v \varpropto Z</math>

==History==
[[File:Henry Moseley.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Henry Moseley]], holding an X-ray tube]]

The [[History of the periodic table|historic periodic table]] was roughly ordered by increasing atomic ''weight'', but in a few famous cases the physical properties of two elements suggested that the heavier ought to precede the lighter.  An example is [[cobalt]] having a weight of 58.9 and [[nickel]] having an atomic weight of 58.7.

[[Henry Moseley]] and other physicists used [[Bragg's law|x-ray diffraction]] to study the elements, and the results of their experiments led to organizing the periodic table by proton count.

== Apparatus ==
Since the spectral emissions for the heavier elements would be in the soft X-ray range (absorbed by air), the spectrometry apparatus had to be enclosed inside a [[vacuum]].<ref name="Brag1915">{{cite book |title=X Rays and Crystal Structure |last=Bragg |first=W.

== Results ==

Moseley found that the <math>K_\alpha</math> lines (in [[Siegbahn notation]]) were indeed related to the atomic number, ''Z.''<ref name="Mose1914" />

Following Bohr's lead, Moseley found that for the spectral lines, this relationship could be ''approximated'' by a simple formula, later called ''Moseley's Law''.
 
:<math> \nu = A \cdot \left(Z - b\right)^2 </math>''<ref name="Mose1914" />

where:

:<math> \nu \ </math> is the frequency of the observed x-ray emission line
:<math> A \ </math> and <math> b \ </math> are constants that depend on the type of line (that is, K, L, etc. in x-ray notation)

:<math> A = \left( \frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{2^2} \right) \cdot </math>  [[Rydberg_constant#Rydberg_frequency|Rydberg frequency]] and  <math> b \ </math>= 1 for  <math>K_\alpha</math> lines, and  <math>A = \left( \frac{1}{2^2} - \frac{1}{3^2} \right) \cdot</math>  ''(Rydberg frequency)'' and  <math> b \ </math>= 7.4 for  <math>L_\alpha</math> lines.<ref name="Mose1914" />

== Derivation ==

Moseley derived his formula empirically by [[line fitting]] the square roots of the X-ray frequencies plotted by atomic number,<ref name="Mose1914" /> and his formula could be explained in terms of the [[Bohr model]] of the atom. 
:<math>E = h\nu = E_\text{i}-E_\text{f}=\frac{m_\text{e} q_\text{e}^2 q_Z^2}{8 h^2 \varepsilon_{0}^2} \left( \frac{1}{n_\text{f}^2} - \frac{1}{n_\text{i}^2} \right) \,</math>

in which
:<math>\varepsilon_{0}</math> is the [[Vacuum_permittivity|permittivity of free space]]
:<math>m_\text{e}</math> is the [[mass of an electron]]
:<math>q_\text{e}</math> is the [[charge of an electron]]
:<math>n_\text{f}</math> is the quantum number of final energy level
:<math>n_\text{i}</math> is the quantum number of initial energy level

It is assumed that the final energy level is less than the initial energy level.

Considering the empirically found constant that approximately reduced (or apparently "screened") the energy of the charges, Bohr's formula for Moseley's <math>K_\alpha</math> X-ray transitions became:

::<math>E= h\nu = E_\text{i}-E_\text{f}=\frac{m_\text{e} q_\text{e}^4}{8 h^2 \varepsilon_{0}^2} \left( \frac{1}{1^2} - \frac{1}{2^2} \right)(Z-1)^2 \, = \left( \frac{3}{4}\right)(Z-1)^2 \times 13.6\ \mathrm{eV}</math><ref name="Mose1914" />

or (dividing both sides by ''h'' to convert ''E'' to <math>\ \nu</math>):<br>

::<math>\nu =\frac{E}{h} = \frac{m_\text{e} q_\text{e}^4}{8 h^3 \varepsilon_{0}^2} \left( \frac{3}{4}\right) (Z-1)^2 = (2.47 \cdot 10^{15} \ \mathrm{Hz})(Z-1)^2 \,</math>

The coefficient in this formula simplifies to a frequency of {{sfrac|3|4''h''}}&nbsp;[[Rydberg constant#Rydberg unit of energy|Ry]], with an approximate value of {{val|2.47|e=15|ul=Hz}}.

== Screening ==

A simplified explanation for the effective charge of a nucleus being one less than its actual charge is that an unpaired electron in the K-shell screens it.<ref>{{cite journal|author=K. R.
