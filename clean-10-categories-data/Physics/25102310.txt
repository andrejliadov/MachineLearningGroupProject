'''Arnold Berliner''' (Gut Mittelneuland bei [[Neisse]], 26 December 1862 – [[Berlin]], 22 March 1942) was a German physicist.

== Biography ==

Berliner graduated in physics from the [[University of Breslau]] in 1886. He worked in the research and development laboratories of the [[Allgemeine Elektrizitäts-Gesellschaft]] (AEG).

Around the middle of 1912 he was appointed by the publishing firm [[Springer Verlag]], [[Berlin]] as editor of the new scientific magazine ''[[Naturwissenschaften]]'', inspired by the prestigious British scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', first published in November 1869. Naturwissenschaften began publication in January 1913. He became a good friend of immunologist [[Paul Ehrlich]] and chemist [[Richard Willstätter]].

=== Nazi Germany and suicide ===

Arnold Berliner was dismissed on 13 August 1935, from the journal he had founded 22 years earlier because of the racial policies on "non-Aryans" implemented by the Nazi government. The decision was reported in ''Nature'' (See ''Nature'' 136, 506-506; 28 September 1935), which editorialized:

{{Quote|We much regret to learn that on August 13 Dr. Arnold Berliner was removed from the editorship of ''Die Naturwissenschaften'', obviously in consequence of non-Aryan policy. This well-known scientific weekly, which in its aims and features has much in common with NATURE, was founded twenty-three years ago by Dr. Berliner, who has been the editor ever since and has devoted his whole activities to the journal, which has a high standard and under his guidance has become the recognised organ for expounding to German scientific readers subjects of interest and importance.}}

Arnold Berliner committed suicide the day before an ''evacuation order'' (meaning deportation to an [[extermination camp]]) became effective.

== Honors ==

In 1933, the main-belt asteroid [[1018 Arnolda]], discovered at Heidelberg Observatory by [[Karl Reinmuth]], was named after Berliner on the occasion of his 70th birthday.<ref name="springer" />
