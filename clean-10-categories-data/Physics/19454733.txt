A '''constant-resistance network''' in [[electrical engineering]] is a network whose [[input resistance]] does not change with [[frequency]] when correctly terminated.  Examples of constant resistance networks include:
* [[Zobel network]]
* [[Lattice phase equaliser]]
* [[Boucherot cell]]
* [[Bridged T delay equaliser]]
