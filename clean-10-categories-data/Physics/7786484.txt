* [[Gravity]], the force of attraction that exists among all bodies that have [[mass]]. The force exerted on each bo the distance between them.
* [[Electromagnetism]] is the force that causes the interaction between electrically charged particles; the areas in which this happens are called electromagnetic fields. Examples of this force include: [[electricity]], [[magnetism]], [[radio wave]]s, [[microwave]]s, [[infrared]], [[visible light]], [[X-rays]] and [[gamma ray]]s. Electromagnetism mediates all chemical, biological, electrical and electronic processes.
* [[Strong nuclear force]]: Unlike gravity and electromagnetism, the strong nuclear force is a short distance force that takes place between fundamental particles within a [[atomic nucleus|nucleus]]. It is [[electric charge|charge]] independent and acts equally between a [[proton]] and a proton, a [[neutron]] and a neutron, and a proton and a neutron. The strong nuclear force is the strongest force in nature; however, its range is small (acting only over distances of the order of 10<sup>−15</sup> m). The strong nuclear force mediates both [[nuclear fission]] and [[nuclear fusion|fusion]] reactions.
* [[Weak nuclear force]]: The weak nuclear force mediates the [[beta decay|β decay]] of a neutron, in which the neutron [[radioactive decay|decays]] into a proton and in the process emits a [[beta particle|β particle]] and an uncharged particle called a [[neutrino]]. As a result of mediating the β decay process, the weak nuclear force plays a key role in [[supernovae|supernovas]]. Both the strong and weak fo(this was not finished)
