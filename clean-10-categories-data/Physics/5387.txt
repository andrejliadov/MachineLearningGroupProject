{{Condensed matter physics}}

'''Condensed matter physics''' is the field of [[physics]] that deals with the macroscopic and microscopic physical properties of [[matter]], especially the [[solid]] and [[liquid]] [[State of matter|phases]] which arise from [[electromagnetic]] forces between [[atom]]s. More generally, the subject deals with "condensed" phases of matter: systems of very many constituents with strong interactions between them. More exotic condensed phases include the [[superconductivity|superconducting]] phase exhibited by certain materials at low [[temperature]], the [[ferromagnet]]ic and [[antiferromagnet]]ic phases of [[spin (physics)|spins]] on [[crystal lattice]]s of atoms, and the [[Bose–Einstein condensate]] found in [[ultracold atom]]ic systems. Condensed matter physicists seek to understand the behavior of these phases by experiments to measure various material properties, and by applying the [[physical law]]s of [[quantum mechanics]], [[electromagnetism]], [[statistical mechanics]], and other [[theoretical physics|theories]] to develop mathematical models.

The diversity of systems and phenomena available for study makes condensed matter physics the most active field of contemporary physics: one third of all [[People of the United States|American]] physicists self-identify as condensed matter physicists,<ref>{{cite web |url= http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20090327141400/http://www.physicstoday.org/jobs/seek/condensed_matter.html |archive-date= 2009-03-27 |website=Physics Today Jobs|title= Condensed Matter Physics Jobs: Careers in Condensed Matter Physics| access-date= 2010-11-01}}</ref> and the Division of Condensed Matter Physics is the largest division at the [[American Physical Society]].<ref name=aps-history>{{cite web|title=History of Condensed Matter Physics|url=http://www.aps.org/units/dcmp/history.cfm|publisher=American Physical Society|access-date=27 March 2012}}</ref>  The field overlaps with [[chemistry]], [[materials science]], [[engineering]] and [[nanotechnology]], and relates closely to [[atomic physics]] and [[biophysics]].

A variety of topics in physics such as [[crystallography]], [[metallurgy]], [[elasticity (physics)|elasticity]], [[magnetism]], etc., were treated as distinct areas until the 1940s, when they were grouped together as ''[[solid state physics]]''. Around the 1960s, the study of physical properties of [[liquid]]s was added to this list, forming the basis for the more comprehensive specialty of condensed matter physics.<ref name=rmp /> The [[Bell Labs|Bell Telephone Laboratories]] was one of the first institutes to conduct a research program in condensed matter physics.<ref name=rmp>{{cite journal|last=Kohn|first=W.|title=An essay on condensed matter physics in the twentieth century|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|year=1999|volume=71|issue=2|url= http://nanoelectronics.unibas.ch/education/ModernPhysics/KohnCondMat.pdf |access-date=27 March 2012|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.71.S59|pages= S59–S77 |bibcode= 1999RvMPS..71...59K|url-status=dead|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130825164926/http://nanoelectronics.unibas.ch/education/ModernPhysics/KohnCondMat.pdf|archive-date=25 August 2013}}</ref>

==Etymology==

According to physicist [[Philip Warren Anderson]], the use of the term "condensed matter" to designate a field of study was coined by him and [[Volker Heine]], when they changed the name of their group at the [[Cavendish Laboratories]], [[Cambridge]] from ''Solid state theory'' to ''Theory of Condensed Matter'' in 1967,<ref name=pwa-princeton>{{cite web|title=Philip Anderson|url=http://www.princeton.edu/physics/people/display_person.xml?netid=pwa&display=faculty |website=Department of Physics|publisher=Princeton University|access-date=27 March 2012}}</ref> as they felt it better included their interest in liquids, [[nuclear matter]], and so on.<ref name=wsn>{{cite journal|title=In Focus: More and Different|url=http://www.worldscientific.com/newsletter/newsletter/nov11n33p02.shtml|journal=World Scientific Newsletter|date=November 2011|volume=33 |page=2|last = Anderson|first = Philip W.}}</ref><ref>{{Cite book|last=Anderson|first=Philip W.|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9HhQDwAAQBAJ|title=Basic Notions Of Condensed Matter Physics|date=2018-03-09|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-429-97374-1|language=en}}</ref> Although Anderson and Heine helped popularize the name "condensed matter", it had been used in Europe for some years, most prominently in the [[Springer Science+Business Media |Springer-Verlag]] journal ''Physics of Condensed Matter'', launched in 1963.<ref>{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dTsgAAAAIAAJ|title=''Physics of Condensed Matter''|volume=1|access-date=20 April 2015|year=1963}}</ref> The name "condensed matter physics" emphasized the commonality of scientific problems encountered by physicists working on solids, liquids, plasmas, and other complex matter, whereas "solid state physics" was often associated with restricted industrial applications of metals and semiconductors. In the 1960s and 70s, some physicists felt the more comprehensive name better fit the funding environment and [[Cold War]] politics of the time.<ref name=martin-pip>{{cite journal|last=Martin|first=Joseph D. |title=What's in a Name Change?

References to "condensed" states can be traced to earlier sources. For example, in the introduction to his 1947 book ''Kinetic Theory of Liquids'',<ref name=Frenkel>{{cite book|last=Frenkel|first=J.|title=Kinetic Theory of Liquids|year=1947|publisher=Oxford University Press}}</ref> [[Yakov Frenkel]] proposed that "The kinetic theory of liquids must accordingly be developed as a generalization and extension of the kinetic theory of solid bodies. As a matter of fact, it would be more correct to unify them under the title of 'condensed bodies'".

One of the first studies of condensed states of matter was by [[People of England|English]] [[chemist]] [[Humphry Davy]], in the first decades of the nineteenth century. Davy observed that of the forty [[chemical element]]s known at the time, twenty-six had [[metal]]lic properties such as [[lustre (mineralogy)|lustre]], [[ductility]] and high electrical and thermal conductivity.<ref name=goodstein>{{cite journal|last1=Goodstein|first1=David|author1-link=David Goodstein|last2=Goodstein|first2=Judith|author2-link=Judith R.

[[Paul Drude]] in 1900 proposed the first theoretical model for a [[classical mechanics|classical]] [[electron]] moving through a metallic solid.<ref name=marvincohen2008 /> Drude's model described properties of metals in terms of a gas of free electrons, and was the first microscopic model to explain empirical observations such as the [[Wiedemann–Franz law]].<ref name="Kittel 1996">{{cite book|last=Kittel|first=Charles|title=[[Introduction to Solid State Physics]]|year=1996|publisher=John Wiley & Sons|isbn=978-0-471-11181-8}}</ref><ref name=Hoddeson-1992>{{cite book|last=Hoddeson|first=Lillian|title=Out of the Crystal Maze: Chapters from The History of Solid State Physics|year=1992|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-505329-6|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WCpPPHhMdRcC&pg=PA29}}</ref>{{rp|27–29}} However, despite the success of Drude's free electron model, it had one notable problem: it was unable to correctly explain the electronic contribution to the [[specific heat]] and magnetic properties of metals, and the temperature dependence of resistivity at low temperatures.<ref name=Kragh2002>{{cite book |last= Kragh |first= Helge |title= Quantum Generations: A History of Physics in the Twentieth Century |publisher= Princeton University Press |edition= Reprint |date= 2002 |isbn= 978-0-691-09552-3}}</ref>{{rp|366–368}}

===Advent of quantum mechanics===
Drude's classical model was augmented by [[Wolfgang Pauli]], [[Arnold Sommerfeld]], [[Felix Bloch]] and other physicists.  Pauli realized that the free electrons in metal must obey the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]].  Using this idea, he developed the theory of [[paramagnetism]] in 1926.  Shortly after, Sommerfeld incorporated the [[Fermi–Dirac statistics]] into the free electron model and made it better to explain the heat capacity.  Two years later, Bloch used [[quantum mechanics]] to describe the motion of an electron in a periodic lattice.<ref name=Kragh2002/>{{rp|366–368}} The mathematics of crystal structures developed by [[Auguste Bravais]], [[Yevgraf Fyodorov]] and others was used to classify crystals by their [[symmetry group]], and tables of crystal structures were the basis for the series ''International Tables of Crystallography'', first published in 1935.<ref name=Aroyo-2006>{{Cite book|last=Aroyo|first=Mois, I. |author2=Müller, Ulrich |author3=Wondratschek, Hans |title=Historical introduction|year=2006|volume=A|pages=2–5|doi=10.1107/97809553602060000537|series=International Tables for Crystallography|isbn=978-1-4020-2355-2|url=http://www.european-arachnology.org/proceedings/19th/Lourenco.PDF|citeseerx=10.1.1.471.4170 }}</ref> [[Band theory|Band structure calculations]] was first used in 1930 to predict the properties of new materials, and in 1947 [[John Bardeen]], [[Walter Brattain]] and [[William Shockley]] developed the first [[semiconductor]]-based [[transistor]], heralding a revolution in electronics.<ref name=marvincohen2008 />

A major revolution came in the field of [[crystallography]] with the discovery of [[quasicrystal]]s by [[Daniel Shechtman]]. In 1982 Shechtman observed that certain metallic [[alloy]]s produce unusual diffractograms that indicated that their crystalline structures are ordered, but lack [[translational symmetry]].

==Theoretical==
Theoretical condensed matter physics involves the use of theoretical models to understand properties of states of matter. These include models to study the electronic properties of solids, such as the [[Drude model]], the [[Electronic band structure|band structure]] and the [[density functional theory]]. Theoretical models have also been developed to study the physics of [[phase transition]]s, such as the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], [[critical exponent]]s and the use of mathematical methods of [[quantum field theory]] and the [[renormalization group]]. Modern theoretical studies involve the use of [[numerical computation]] of electronic structure and mathematical tools to understand phenomena such as [[high-temperature superconductivity]], [[topological phase]]s, and [[gauge symmetry|gauge symmetries]].

===Emergence===
{{Main|Emergence}}

Theoretical understanding of condensed matter physics is closely related to the notion of [[emergence]], wherein complex assemblies of particles behave in ways dramatically different from their individual constituents.<ref name=coleman>{{cite book|last=Coleman |first=Piers |title=Introduction to Many Body Physics |year=2016 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=978-0-521-86488-6|url=http://www.cambridge.org/us/academic/subjects/physics/condensed-matter-physics-nanoscience-and-mesoscopic-physics/introduction-many-body-physics}}</ref><ref name=":0" /> For example, a range of phenomena related to high temperature superconductivity are understood poorly, although the microscopic physics of individual electrons and lattices is well known.<ref name=nsf-emergence>{{cite web|title=Understanding Emergence|url=https://www.nsf.gov/news/overviews/physics/physics_q01.jsp|publisher=National Science Foundation|access-date=30 March 2012}}</ref> Similarly, models of condensed matter systems have been studied where [[collective excitation]]s behave like [[photon]]s and [[electron]]s, thereby describing [[electromagnetism]] as an emergent phenomenon.<ref name=levin-rmp>{{cite journal|last=Levin|first=Michael|author2=Wen, Xiao-Gang |title=Colloquium: Photons and electrons as emergent phenomena|journal=Reviews of Modern Physics|year=2005|volume=77|issue=3|doi=10.1103/RevModPhys.77.871|arxiv= cond-mat/0407140 |bibcode= 2005RvMP...77..871L |pages=871–879 |s2cid=117563047}}</ref> Emergent properties can also occur at the interface between materials: one example is the [[lanthanum aluminate-strontium titanate interface]], where two non-magnetic insulators are joined to create conductivity, [[superconductivity]], and [[ferromagnetism]].

===Electronic theory of solids===
{{Main|Electronic band structure}}

The metallic state has historically been an important building block for studying properties of solids.<ref name="AshcroftMermin1976"/> The first theoretical description of metals was given by [[Paul Drude]] in 1900 with the [[Drude model]], which explained electrical and thermal properties by describing a metal as an [[ideal gas]] of then-newly discovered [[electron]]s.

=== Symmetry breaking ===
{{Main|Symmetry breaking}}

Some states of matter exhibit ''symmetry breaking'', where the relevant laws of physics possess some form of [[Symmetry (physics)|symmetry]] that is broken. A common example is [[crystal|crystalline solid]]s, which break continuous [[translational symmetry]]. Other examples include magnetized [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]], which break [[rotational symmetry]], and more exotic states such as the ground state of a [[BCS theory|BCS]] [[superconductor]], that breaks [[U(1)]] phase rotational symmetry.<ref>{{cite web |url = https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2008/nambu-lecture.html |title= Spontaneous Symmetry Breaking in Particle Physics: a Case of Cross Fertilization |last= Nambu |first= Yoichiro |date= 8 December 2008 |website= Nobelprize.org }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last=Greiter |first=Martin |arxiv=cond-mat/0503400 |title=Is electromagnetic gauge invariance spontaneously violated in superconductors? |date=16 March 2005 |doi=10.1016/j.aop.2005.03.008 |volume=319 |issue=2005 |journal=Annals of Physics |pages=217–249 |bibcode=2005AnPhy.319..217G |s2cid=55104377 }}</ref>

[[Goldstone's theorem]] in [[quantum field theory]] states that in a system with broken continuous symmetry, there may exist excitations with arbitrarily low energy, called the Goldstone [[boson]]s. For example, in crystalline solids, these correspond to [[phonon]]s, which are quantized versions of lattice vibrations.<ref name=goldstone>{{cite journal|last=Leutwyler|first=H.|title=Phonons as Goldstone bosons|journal= Helv. Phys. Acta  |volume=70|issue=1997|year=1997|arxiv=hep-ph/9609466|bibcode= 1996hep.ph....9466L|pages=275–286}}</ref>

=== Phase transition ===
{{Main|Phase transition}}

Phase transition refers to the change of phase of a system, which is brought about by change in an external parameter such as [[temperature]].  Classical phase transition occurs at finite temperature when the order of the system was destroyed.  For example, when ice melts and becomes water, the ordered crystal structure is destroyed.  

In [[quantum phase transition]]s,  the temperature is set to [[absolute zero]], and the non-thermal control parameter, such as pressure or magnetic field,  causes the phase transitions when order is destroyed by [[quantum fluctuation]]s originating from the [[Heisenberg uncertainty principle]]. Here, the different quantum phases of the system refer to distinct [[ground state]]s of the [[Hamiltonian matrix]].  Understanding the behavior of quantum phase transition is important in the difficult tasks of explaining the properties of rare-earth magnetic insulators, high-temperature superconductors, and other substances.<ref name=Vojta2003/>

Two classes of phase transitions occur: ''first-order transitions'' and ''second-order'' or ''continuous transitions''. For the latter, the two phases involved do not co-exist at the transition temperature, also called the [[Critical point (thermodynamics)|critical point]].  Near the critical point, systems undergo critical behavior, wherein several of their properties such as [[correlation length]], [[specific heat]], and [[magnetic susceptibility]] diverge exponentially.<ref name=Vojta2003>{{cite journal |last=Vojta |first=Matthias |arxiv= cond-mat/0309604 |title=Quantum phase transitions |year=2003 |doi=10.1088/0034-4885/66/12/R01 |volume=66 |issue=12 |journal=Reports on Progress in Physics |pages=2069–2110|bibcode= 2003RPPh...66.2069V |citeseerx=10.1.1.305.3880 |s2cid=15806867 }}</ref>  These critical phenomena present serious challenges to physicists because normal [[Macroscopic scale|macroscopic]] laws are no longer valid in the region, and novel ideas and methods must be invented to find the new laws that can describe the system.<ref name=NRC1986>{{cite book |title = Condensed-Matter Physics, Physics Through the 1990s |publisher=National Research Council|year=1986 |url = http://www.nap.edu/catalog/626/an-overview-physics-through-the-1990s |isbn=978-0-309-03577-4 |doi=10.17226/626}}</ref>{{rp|75ff}}

The simplest theory that can describe continuous phase transitions is the [[Ginzburg–Landau theory]], which works in the so-called [[mean field approximation]].  However, it can only roughly explain continuous phase transition for ferroelectrics and type I superconductors which involves long range microscopic interactions.  For other types of systems that involves short range interactions near the critical point, a better theory is needed.<ref name="University1989">{{cite book|author=Malcolm F. Collins Professor of Physics McMaster University|title=Magnetic Critical Scattering|publisher=Oxford University Press, USA|isbn=978-0-19-536440-8|date=1989-03-02}}</ref>{{rp|8–11}}

Near the critical point, the fluctuations happen over broad range of size scales while the feature of the whole system is scale invariant.  [[Renormalization group]] methods successively average out the shortest wavelength fluctuations in stages while retaining their effects into the next stage.  Thus, the changes of a physical system as viewed at different size scales can be investigated systematically.  The methods, together with powerful computer simulation, contribute greatly to the explanation of the critical phenomena associated with continuous phase transition.<ref name=NRC1986/>{{rp|11}}

==Experimental==
Experimental condensed matter physics involves the use of experimental probes to try to discover new properties of materials. Such probes include effects of electric and [[magnetic field]]s, measuring [[response function]]s, [[transport theory (statistical physics)|transport properties]] and [[thermometry]].<ref name=exptcm>{{cite book|last=Richardson|first=Robert C.|title=Experimental methods in Condensed Matter Physics at Low Temperatures|year=1988|publisher=Addison-Wesley|isbn=978-0-201-15002-5}}</ref> Commonly used experimental methods include [[spectroscopy]], with probes such as [[X-ray spectroscopy|X-rays]], [[infrared spectroscopy|infrared light]] and [[inelastic neutron scattering]]; study of thermal response, such as [[specific heat]] and measuring transport via thermal and heat [[conduction (heat)|conduction]].

===Scattering===
{{Further|Scattering}}

Several condensed matter experiments involve scattering of an experimental probe, such as [[X-ray]], optical [[photon]]s, [[neutron]]s, etc., on constituents of a material. The choice of scattering probe depends on the observation energy scale of interest. [[Visible light]] has energy on the scale of 1 [[electron volt]] (eV) and is used as a scattering probe to measure variations in material properties such as [[dielectric constant]] and [[refractive index]]. X-rays have energies of the order of 10 [[electron volt|keV]] and hence are able to probe atomic length scales, and are used to measure variations in electron charge density.<ref name=chaikin-lubensky>{{cite book|last1=Chaikin|first1=P.

[[Neutron]]s can also probe atomic length scales and are used to study scattering off nuclei and electron [[Spin (physics)|spins]] and magnetization (as neutrons have spin but no charge). Coulomb and [[Mott scattering]] measurements can be made by using electron beams as scattering probes.<ref name=chaikin-lubensky/>{{rp|33–34}}<ref name="Zhang2012">{{cite book|author=Wentao Zhang|title=Photoemission Spectroscopy on High Temperature Superconductor: A Study of Bi2Sr2CaCu2O8 by Laser-Based Angle-Resolved Photoemission|date=22 August 2012|publisher=Springer Science & Business Media|isbn=978-3-642-32472-7}}</ref>{{rp|39–43}}  Similarly, [[positron]] annihilation can be used as an indirect measurement of local electron density.<ref name=siegel-1980>{{cite journal|last=Siegel|first=R.

===Nuclear spectroscopy===
The [[local structure]], the structure of the nearest neighbour atoms, of condensed matter can be investigated with methods of [[nuclear spectroscopy]], which are very sensitive to small changes. Using specific and radioactive [[Atomic nucleus|nuclei]], the nucleus becomes the probe that interacts with its sourrounding electric and magnetic fields ([[hyperfine structure|hyperfine interactions]]). The methods are suitable to study defects, diffusion, phase change, magnetism. Common methods are e.g. [[nuclear magnetic resonance|NMR]], [[Mössbauer spectroscopy]], or [[perturbed angular correlation]] (PAC). Especially PAC is ideal for the study of phase changes at extreme temperature above 2000°C due to no temperature dependence of the method.

[[Ultracold atom]] trapping in optical lattices is an experimental tool commonly used in condensed matter physics, and in [[atomic, molecular, and optical physics]]. The method involves using optical lasers to form an [[interference (wave propagation)|interference pattern]], which acts as a ''lattice'', in which ions or atoms can be placed at very low temperatures.

In [[quantum computation]], information is represented by quantum bits, or [[qubit]]s. The qubits may [[quantum decoherence|decohere]] quickly before useful computation is completed. This serious problem must be solved before quantum computing may be realized. To solve this problem, several promising approaches are proposed in condensed matter physics, including [[Josephson junction]] qubits, [[spintronic]] qubits using the [[Spin (physics)|spin]] orientation of magnetic materials, or the topological non-Abelian [[anyon]]s from [[fractional quantum Hall effect]] states.<ref name=yeh-perspective />

Condensed matter physics also has important uses for [[biophysics]], for example, the experimental method of [[magnetic resonance imaging]], which is widely used in medical diagnosis.<ref name=yeh-perspective />
