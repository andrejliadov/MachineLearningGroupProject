'''''HyperPhysics''''' is an educational [[website]] about [[physics]] topics. 
The [[information architecture]] of the website is based on [[HyperCard]], the platform on which the material was originally developed,<ref>{{cite journal|last=Graham |first=Andrew |title=HyperPhysics |journal=[[The Physics Teacher]] |volume=40 |year=2002 |pages=318 |doi=10.1119/1.1543848}}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last=Daukantas |first=Patricia |title=Computer-Supported Education Gets Spotlight in College Park |journal=[[Computers in Physics]] |volume=10 |pages=513 |year=1996 |doi=10.1063/1.4822492}}</ref> and a [[thesaurus]] organization, with thousands of controlled links and usual [[tree structure|trees]] organizing topics from general to specific. It also exploits [[concept maps]] to facilitate smooth navigation.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Lalingkar |first1=Aparna |last2=Ramanathan |first2=Chandrasekhar |last3=Ramani |first3=Srinivasan |title=An Educational Resources Broker System for Collaborative Sharing of Knowledge-Centric Content |journal=2011 IEEE International Conference on Technology for Education |date=2011-08-30 |doi=10.1109/T4E.2011.18}}</ref> ''HyperPhysics'' is hosted by [[Georgia State University]] and authored by Georgia State faculty member Dr. '''Rod Nave'''.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://phy-astr.gsu.edu/contact-us/faculty-2/ |title=Faculty - Physics & Astronomy |publisher=Georgia State University |access-date=2015-05-25}} As of 2015, Nave is listed as an emeritus professor of physics.</ref><ref>{{cite web|title=Web life: Hyperphysics |url=https://physicsworld.com/a/web-life-hyperphysics/ |website=[[Physics World]] |date=2009-05-01 |access-date=2018-10-01}}</ref>
