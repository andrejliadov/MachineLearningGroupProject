'''Albert of Saxony''' ([[Latin]]: ''Albertus de Saxonia''; c. 1320 – 8 July 1390) was a [[German people|German]] [[philosopher]] known for his contributions to [[logic]] and [[physics]]. He was [[bishop of Halberstadt]] from 1366 until his death.

==Life==
Albert was born at [[Rickensdorf]] near [[Helmstedt]], the son of a farmer in a small village; but because of his talent, he was sent to study at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] and the [[University of Paris]].

At Paris, he became a master of arts (a professor), and held this post from 1351 until 1362. He also studied theology at the [[College of Sorbonne]], although without receiving a degree. In 1353, he was [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the University of Paris. After 1362, Albert went to the court of [[Pope Urban V]] in [[Avignon]] as an envoy of [[Rudolf IV, Duke of Austria]], in order to negotiate the founding of the [[University of Vienna]]. The negotiations were successful, and Albert became the first rector of this University in 1365.

In 1366, Albert was elected [[bishop of Halberstadt]] (counted as '''Albert III'''), Halberstadt being the diocese in which he was born. As Bishop of Halberstadt, he allied himself with [[Magnus with the Necklace, Duke of Brunswick-Lüneburg]], against [[Gebhard of Berg]], [[Bishop of Hildesheim]], and was taken prisoner by Gebhard in the [[battle of Dinckler]] in 1367.

He died at [[Halberstadt]] in 1390.

==Philosophy==
Albert was a pupil of [[Jean Buridan]]<ref name="Clagett 522"/> and was very much influenced by Buridan's teachings on [[physics]] and [[logic]]. As a natural philosopher, he contributed to the spread of Parisian [[natural philosophy]] throughout [[Italy]] and central Europe. Similar to Buridan, Albert combined [[critical analysis]] of [[language]] with epistemological [[pragmatism]]. Albert distinguishes, as his teacher did, between what is absolutely impossible or contradictory and what is impossible “in the common course of nature” and considers hypotheses under circumstances that are not naturally possible but imaginable given God's absolute power. Albert refused to extend the [[reference]] of a [[Physical body|physical]] [[Terminology|term]] to [[supernatural]], purely [[Object of the mind|imaginary]] possibilities.  Later regarded as one of the principal adherents of [[nominalism]], along with his near contemporaries at Paris, namely Buridan and [[Marsilius of Inghen]], whose works are often so similar as to be confused with each other. The subsequent wide circulation of Albert's work made him a better-known figure in some areas than more important contemporaries like Buridan and [[Nicole Oresme]].

Albert's work in [[logic]] also shows strong influence by [[William of Ockham]], whose commentaries on the ''logica vetus'' (i.&nbsp;e. on [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], and [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Categoriae]]'' and ''[[De interpretatione]]'') were made the subject of a series of works called ''Quaestiones'' by Albert.

[[File:Theory of impetus.svg|thumb|Three stage [[theory of impetus]] according to Albert von Sachsen]]

Albert of Saxony's teachings on logic and metaphysics were extremely influential. The [[theory of impetus]] introduced a third stage to the two stage theory of [[Avicenna]].<ref>Michael McCloskey: ''Impetustheorie und Intuition in der Physik.''. In: ''Newtons Universum''. Verlag Spektrum der Wissenschaft: Heidelberg 1990, {{ISBN|3-89330-750-8}}, p. 18.</ref>

# Initial stage. Motion is in a straight line in direction of impetus which is dominant while gravity is insignificant
# Intermediate stage. Path begins to deviate downwards from straight line as part of a great circle as air resistance slows projectile and gravity recovers.
# Last stage. Gravity alone draws projectile downwards vertically as all impetus is spent.

This theory was a precursor to the modern theory of [[inertia]].

Although Buridan remained the predominant figure in logic, Albert's ''Perutilis logica'' (c. 1360) was destined to serve as a popular text because of its systematic nature and also because it takes up and develops essential aspects of the Ockhamist position. Albert accepted Ockham's conception of the nature of a [[Sign (semiotics)|sign]]. Albert believed that [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]] rests on a referential relation of the sign to the individual thing, and that the spoken sign depends for its signification on the conceptual sign. Albert followed Ockham in his conception of [[universals]] and in his theory of [[supposition]].  Specifically, Albert preserved Ockham's notion of simple supposition, understood as the direct reference of a term to the concept on which it depends when it signifies an extra-mental thing. Albert followed Ockham in his theory of [[Categories (Aristotle)|categories]] and contrary to Buridan, refused to treat quantity as a feature of reality in its own right, but rather reduced it to a disposition of [[Substance theory|substance]] and [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]]. Albert established signification through a referential relation to a singular thing defining the relation of the spoken to conceptual signs as a relation of subordination.  Albert's treatment of relation was highly original.  Although, like Ockham, he refused to construe relations as things distinct from [[Absolute (philosophy)|absolute]] entities, he clearly ascribed them to an act of the [[soul]] by which absolute entities are compared and placed in relation to each other.  He therefore completely rejected certain propositions Ockham had admitted reasonable, even if he did not construe them in the same way.

Albert's voluminous collection of ''Sophismata'' (c. 1359) examined various sentences that raise difficulties of interpretation due to the presence of [[syncategorematic term]]s such as [[Quantifier (logic)|quantifiers]] and certain [[prepositions]], which, according to medieval logicians, do not have a proper and determinate signification but rather modify the signification of the other terms in the [[proposition]]s in which they occur.  In his ''Sophismata,'' he followed [[William Heytesbury]].  In his analysis of [[Epistemic modality|epistemic]] verbs or of [[infinity]], Albert admitted that a proposition has its own signification, which is not that of its [[Terminology|terms]]: just like a syncategorematic term, a proposition signifies a “mode of a thing.”  Albert made use of the idea of the distinguishable signification of the proposition in defining [[truth]] and in dealing with “[[insolubles]]” or [[paradox]]es of [[self-reference]].  In this work he shows that since every proposition, by its very form, signifies that it is true, an insoluble proposition will turn out to be false because it will signify at once both that it is true and that it is false.

Albert also authored commentaries on ''Ars Vetus'', a set of twenty-five ''Quaestiones logicales'' (c. 1356) that involved semantical problems and the status of logic, and ''Quaestiones'' on the ''Posterior Analytics''. Albert explored in a series of disputed [[question]]s the status of [[logic]] and [[semantics]], as well as the [[theory of reference]] and [[theory of truth|truth]].  Albert was influenced by English logicians and was influential in the diffusion of [[Terminism#Philosophical terminism|terminist]] logic in central Europe.  Albert is considered a major contributor in his theory of consequences, found in his ''Perutilis Logica''. Albert took a major step forward in the medieval theory of [[logical deduction]].

But it was his commentary on [[Aristotle]]'s ''[[Physics (Aristotle)|Physics]]'' that was especially widely read. Many manuscripts of it can be found in France and Italy, in Erfurt and Prague. Albert's ''Physics'' basically guaranteed the transmission of the Parisian tradition to Italy, where it was authoritative along with the works of [[William Heytesbury|Heytesbury]] and [[John Dumbleton]]. His commentary on Aristotle's ''[[De caelo]]'' was also influential, eventually eclipsing Buridan's commentary on this text. [[Blasius of Parma]] read it in Bologna between 1379 and 1382. A little later, it enjoyed a wide audience at Vienna. His ''Treatise on Proportions'' was often quoted in Italy where, in addition to the texts of [[Thomas Bradwardine]] and [[Oresme]], it influenced the application of the theory of [[Ratio|proportions]] to [[Motion (physics)|motion]].

Albert's commentaries on the ''[[Nicomachean Ethics]]'' and the ''[[Economics (Aristotle)|Economics]]'' also survive (both unedited), as well as several short [[mathematical]] texts, most notably ''Tractatus proportionum'' (c. 1353). Although Albert studied [[theology]] in Paris, no theological writing survived.

Albert played an essential role in the diffusion throughout Italy and central Europe of Parisian ideas which bore the mark of Buridan's teachings, but which were also clearly shaped by Albert's own grasp of English innovations. At the same time, Albert was not merely a compiler of the work of others. He knew how to construct proofs of undeniable originality on many topics in logic and physics.
