{{short description|Technical termdirection of polarization of linearly-polarized light or other electromagnetic radiation;}}
[[File:Field-vectors-and-propagation-directions.svg|thumb|300px|'''Fig.{{nnbsp}}1''':{{big|&nbsp;}}Field vectors ('''E''',{{hsp}}'''D''',{{hsp}}'''B''',{{hsp}}'''H''') and propagation directions (ray and wave-normal) for linearly-polarized plane electromagnetic waves in a non-magnetic birefringent crystal.{{r|lunney-weaire-2006}} The plane of vibration, containing both electric vectors ('''E'''&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;'''D''') and both propagation vectors, is sometimes called the "plane of polarization" by modern authors. Fresnel's "plane of polarization", traditionally used in optics, is the plane containing the magnetic vectors ('''B'''&nbsp;&amp;&nbsp;'''H''') and the ''wave-normal''. Malus's original "plane of polarization" was the plane containing the magnetic vectors and the ''ray''.&nbsp; (In an isotropic medium,&nbsp; {{math|''θ'' {{=}} 0}}&nbsp; and Malus's plane merges with Fresnel's.)]]

The term '''''plane of polarization''''' refers to the direction of [[polarization (waves)|polarization]] of ''[[linear polarization|linearly-polarized]]'' light or other [[electromagnetic radiation]]. Unfortunately the term is used with two contradictory meanings. As originally defined by [[Étienne-Louis Malus]] in 1811,<ref name=buch54>Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}54.</ref> the plane of polarization coincided (although this was not known at the time) with the plane containing the direction of propagation and the ''magnetic'' vector.<ref>Stratton, 1941, p.{{hsp}}280; Born & Wolf, 1970, pp.{{nnbsp}}43,{{tsp}}681.</ref> In modern literature, the term ''plane of polarization'', if it is used at all, is likely to mean the plane containing the direction of propagation and the ''electric'' vector,<ref name=luntz/> because the electric field has the greater propensity to interact with matter.<ref name="bw28">Born & Wolf, 1970, p.{{hsp}}28.</ref>

For waves in a [[birefringence|birefringent]] (doubly-refractive) crystal, under the old definition, one must also specify whether the direction of propagation means the ray direction or the wave-[[normal (geometry)|normal]] direction, because these directions generally differ and are both perpendicular to the magnetic vector (Fig.{{nnbsp}}1). Malus, as an adherent of the [[corpuscular theory of light]], could only choose the ray direction. But [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]], in his successful effort to explain double refraction under the [[wave theory of light|wave theory]] (1822 onward), found it more useful to choose the wave-normal direction, with the result that the supposed vibrations of the medium were then consistently perpendicular to the plane of polarization.<ref name=fh318>Fresnel, 1827, tr.&nbsp;Hobson, p.{{nnbsp}}318.</ref> In an [[isotropy|isotropic]] medium such as air, the ray and wave-normal directions are the same, and Fresnel's modification makes no difference.

Fresnel also admitted that, had he not felt constrained by the received terminology, it would have been more natural to define the plane of polarization as the plane containing the vibrations and the direction of propagation.<ref name=fy406>Fresnel, 1822, tr.&nbsp;Young, part&nbsp;7, [https://books.google.com/books?id=N69MAAAAYAAJ&pg=PA406 p.{{nnbsp}}406].</ref> That plane, which became known as the plane of ''vibration'', is perpendicular to Fresnel's "plane of polarization" but identical with the plane that modern writers tend to call by that name!

It has been argued that the term ''plane of polarization'', because of its historical ambiguity, should be avoided in original writing. One can easily specify the orientation of a particular field vector; and even the term ''plane of vibration'' carries less risk of confusion than ''plane of polarization''.<ref>Born & Wolf, 1970, pp.{{nnbsp}}28,{{hsp}}43.</ref>

== Physics of the term ==

[[File:EM-Wave.gif|thumb|'''Fig.{{nnbsp}}2''':{{big|&nbsp;}}Linearly-polarized (plane-polarized) [[sine wave|sinusoidal]] electromagnetic wave in an ''isotropic'' medium, propagating in the ''x'' direction (the ray direction and wave-normal direction), with the electric field vectors '''E''' and '''D''' in the ''y'' direction, and the magnetic field vectors '''B''' and '''H''' in the ''z'' direction.&nbsp; (The situation in a {{nowrap|''non''-isotropic}} medium is more complicated; cf.&nbsp;Fig.{{nnbsp}}1.)]]

For [[electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic (EM) waves]] in an ''isotropic'' medium (that is, a medium whose properties are independent of direction), the [[electric field]] [[Euclidean vector|vectors]] ('''E''' and '''D''') are in one direction, and the [[magnetic field]] vectors ('''B''' and '''H''') are in another direction, perpendicular to the first, and the direction of propagation is perpendicular to both the electric and the magnetic vectors. In this case the direction of propagation is both the ''ray'' direction and the ''wave-normal'' direction (the direction perpendicular to the [[wavefront]]). For a [[linear polarization|''linearly''-polarized]] wave (also called a ''plane''-polarized wave), the orientations of the field vectors are fixed (Fig.{{nnbsp}}2).

Because innumerable materials are [[dielectric]]s or [[electrical conductor|conductors]] while comparatively few are [[ferromagnetism|ferromagnets]], the [[reflection (physics)|reflection]] or [[refraction]] of EM waves (including [[light]]) is more often due to differences in the ''electric'' properties of media than to differences in their magnetic properties. That circumstance tends to draw attention to the ''electric'' vectors, so that we tend to think of the direction of polarization as the direction of the electric vectors, and the "plane of polarization" as the plane containing the electric vectors and the direction of propagation.

[[File:Screen dish antenna.jpg|thumb|left|'''Fig.{{nnbsp}}3''':{{big|&nbsp;}}Vertically-polarized parabolic-grid [[microwave]] antenna. In this case the stated polarization refers to the alignment of the electric ('''E''') field, hence the alignment of the closely spaced metal ribs in the reflector.]]

Indeed, that is the convention used in the online ''Encyclopædia Britannica'',{{r|luntz}} and in [[Richard Feynman|Feynman]]'s lecture on polarization.{{r|feynman-1963}} In the latter case one must infer the convention from the context: Feynman keeps emphasizing the direction of the ''electric'' ('''E''') vector and leaves the reader to presume that the "plane of polarization" contains that vector — and this interpretation indeed fits the examples he gives. The same vector is used to describe the polarization of radio signals and [[antenna (radio)#Polarization|antennas]] (Fig.{{nnbsp}}3).<ref name="auto">Stratton, 1941, p.{{hsp}}280.</ref>

If the medium is magnetically isotropic but electrically ''non''-isotopic (like a [[birefringence|doubly-refracting]] crystal), the magnetic vectors '''B''' and '''H''' are still parallel, and the electric vectors '''E''' and '''D''' are still perpendicular to both, and the ray direction is still perpendicular to '''E''' and the magnetic vectors, and the wave-normal direction is still perpendicular to '''D''' and the magnetic vectors; but there is generally a small angle between the electric vectors '''E''' and '''D''', hence the same angle between the ray direction and the wave-normal direction (Fig.{{nnbsp}}1).{{r|lunney-weaire-2006}}<ref>Born & Wolf, 1970, p.{{hsp}}668.</ref>{{tsp}} Hence '''D''', '''E''', the wave-normal direction, and the ray direction are all in the same plane, and it is all the more natural to define that plane as the "plane of polarization".

This "natural" definition, however, depends on the theory of EM waves developed by [[James Clerk Maxwell]] in the 1860s — whereas the word ''polarization'' was coined about 50 years earlier, and the associated mystery dates back even further.

== History of the term ==

=== Three candidates ===

Whether by accident or by design, the plane of polarization has always been defined as the plane containing a field vector and a direction of propagation. In Fig.{{nnbsp}}1, there are three such planes, to which we may assign numbers for ease of reference:
:<span id="plane1"></span>(1)&nbsp; the plane containing both electric vectors and both propagation directions&nbsp; (i.e., the plane normal to the magnetic vectors);

:<span id="plane2a"></span>(2a)&nbsp; the plane containing the magnetic vectors and the wave-normal&nbsp; (i.e., the plane normal to '''D''');

:<span id="plane2b"></span>(2b)&nbsp; the plane containing the magnetic vectors and the ray&nbsp; (i.e., the plane normal to '''E''').
In an isotropic medium, '''E''' and '''D''' have the same direction,<ref group=Note>This conclusion does not follow if the medium is [[optical rotation|optically rotating]] (see e.g. Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{nnbsp}}253n,{{nnbsp}}257n); however, throughout this article, the existence of a stable plane of polarization requires the absence of optical rotation.</ref> so that the ray and wave-normal directions merge, and the planes (2a) and (2b) become one:
:<span id="plane2"></span>(2)&nbsp; the plane containing both magnetic vectors and both propagation directions&nbsp; (i.e., the plane normal to the electric vectors).

=== Malus's choice ===

[[File:Calcite and polarizing filter.gif|frame|'''Fig.{{nnbsp}}4''':{{big|&nbsp;}}Printed label seen through a doubly-refracting calcite crystal{{hsp}} and a modern polarizing filter (rotated to show the different polarizations of the two images).]]

Polarization was discovered — but not named or understood — by [[Christiaan Huygens]], as he investigated the [[birefringence|double refraction]] of "Iceland crystal" (transparent [[calcite]], now called [[Iceland spar]]). The essence of his discovery, published in his ''Treatise on Light'' (1690), was as follows. When a ray (meaning a narrow beam of light) passes through two similarly oriented calcite crystals at normal incidence, the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the ordinary refraction in the second, while the extraordinary ray emerging from the first suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second. But when the second crystal is rotated 90° about the incident rays, the roles are interchanged, so that the ordinary ray emerging from the first crystal suffers only the extraordinary refraction in the second, and vice versa. At intermediate positions of the second crystal, each ray emerging from the first is doubly refracted by the second, giving four rays in total; and as the crystal is rotated from the initial orientation to the perpendicular one, the brightnesses of the rays vary, giving a smooth transition between the extreme cases in which there are only two final rays.<ref>Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson, pp.{{nnbsp}}92–4.</ref>

Huygens defined a ''principal section'' of a calcite crystal as a plane normal to a natural surface and parallel to the axis of the obtuse solid angle.<ref>Huygens, 1690, tr.&nbsp;Thompson, pp.{{nnbsp}}55–6.</ref> This axis was parallel to the axes of the [[spheroid]]al [[Huygens–Fresnel principle|secondary waves]] by which he (correctly) explained the directions of the extraordinary refraction.

[[File:Etienne-Louis Malus.jpg|thumb|left|<div style="text-align: center;">Étienne-Louis Malus (1775–1812).</div>]]

The term ''polarization'' was coined by [[Étienne-Louis Malus]] in 1811.<ref name=buch54/>&nbsp; In&nbsp;1808, in the midst of confirming Huygens' geometric description of double refraction (while disputing his physical explanation), Malus had discovered that when a ray of light is reflected off a non-metallic surface at the appropriate angle, it behaves like ''one'' of the two rays emerging from a calcite crystal.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{nnbsp}}31–43; Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{nnbsp}}191–2.</ref><ref group=Note>The angle of reflection at which this modification occurs became known as ''[[Brewster's angle]]'', after its dependence on the refractive index was determined experimentally by [[David Brewster]] in 1815.</ref> As this behavior had previously been known only in connection with double refraction, Malus described it in that context. In particular, he defined the ''plane of polarization'' of a polarized ray as the plane, containing the ray, in which a principal section of a calcite crystal must lie in order to cause only ''ordinary'' refraction.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, p.{{hsp}}45.</ref> This definition was all the more reasonable because it meant that when a ray was polarized by reflection (off an isotopic medium), the plane of polarization was the [[plane of incidence]] and reflection — that is, the plane containing the incident ray, the normal to the reflective surface, and the polarized reflected ray. But, as we now know, this plane happens to contain the ''magnetic'' vectors of the polarized ray, not the electric vectors.<ref>Born & Wolf, 1970, pp.{{nnbsp}}43,{{tsp}}681.</ref>

The plane of the ray and the magnetic vectors is the one numbered [[#plane2b|(2b)]] above. The implication that the plane of polarization contains the ''magnetic'' vectors is still found in the definition given in the online Merriam-Webster dictionary.{{r|merriamW}} Even [[Julius Adams Stratton]], having said that "It is customary to define the polarization in terms of '''E'''", promptly adds: "In optics, however, the orientation of the vectors is specified traditionally by the 'plane of polarization,' by which is meant the plane normal to '''E''' containing both '''H''' and the axis of propagation."<ref name="auto"/> That definition is identical with Malus's.

=== Fresnel's choice ===

[[File:Augustin Fresnel.jpg|thumb|<div style="text-align: center;">Augustin-Jean Fresnel (1788–1827).</div>]]

In 1821, [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] announced his hypothesis that light waves are exclusively ''[[transverse wave|transverse]]'' and therefore ''always'' polarized in the sense of having a particular transverse orientation, and that what we call ''unpolarized'' light is in fact light whose orientation is rapidly and randomly changing.<ref>Buchwald, 1989, pp.{{nnbsp}}227–9.</ref> Supposing that light waves were analogous to [[s-wave|shear waves]] in [[elasticity (physics)|elastic solids]], and that a higher [[refractive index]] corresponded to a higher [[density]] of the [[luminiferous aether]], he found that he could account for the partial reflection (including polarization by reflection) at the interface between two transparent isotropic media, provided that the vibrations of the aether were perpendicular to the plane of polarization.<ref>Darrigol, 2012, p.{{nnbsp}}212.</ref> Thus the polarization, according to the received definition, was "in" a certain plane if the vibrations were ''perpendicular'' to that plane!

Fresnel himself found this implication inconvenient; later that year he wrote:
::Adopting this hypothesis, it would have been more natural to have called the plane of polarisation that in which the oscillations are supposed to be made: but I&nbsp;wished to avoid making any change in the received appellations.<ref name=fy406/><ref group=Note>The actual writing of this treatise (Fresnel, 1822) was apparently completed by mid 1821; see I.&nbsp;Grattan-Guinness, ''Convolutions in French Mathematics, 1800–1840'', Basel: Birkhäuser, 1990, vol.{{tsp}}2, p.{{nnbsp}}884.</ref>
But he soon felt obliged to make a less radical change. In his successful model of double refraction, the displacement of the medium was constrained to be tangential to the wavefront, while the force was allowed to deviate from the displacement and from the wavefront.<ref>Aldis, 1879, pp.{{nnbsp}}8–9.</ref> Hence, if the vibrations were perpendicular to the plane of polarization, then the plane of polarization contained the wave-normal but not necessarily the ray.<ref>Aldis, 1879, pp.{{nnbsp}}9,{{hsp}}20.</ref> In his "Second Memoir" on double refraction, Fresnel formally adopted this new definition, acknowledging that it agreed with the old definition in an isotropic medium such as air, but not in a birefringent crystal.<ref name=fh318/>

The vibrations normal to Malus's plane of polarization are electric, and the electric vibration tangential to the wavefront is '''D''' (Fig.{{nnbsp}}1). Thus, in terms of the above numbering, Fresnel changed the "plane of polarization" from [[#plane2b|(2b)]] to [[#plane2a|(2a)]]. Fresnel's definition remains compatible with the Merriam-Webster definition,{{r|merriamW}} which fails to specify the propagation direction. And it remains compatible with Stratton's definition,<ref name="auto"/> because that is given in the context of an isotropic medium, in which planes (2a) and (2b) merge into [[#plane2|(2)]].

What Fresnel called the "more natural" choice was a plane containing '''D''' and a direction of propagation. In Fig.{{nnbsp}}1, the only plane meeting that specification is the one labeled "Plane of vibration" and later numbered [[#plane1|(1)]] — that is, the one that ''modern'' authors tend to identify with the "plane of polarization". We might therefore wish that Fresnel had been less deferential to his predecessors. That scenario, however, is less realistic than it may seem, because even after Fresnel's transverse-wave theory was generally accepted, the direction of the vibrations was the subject of continuing debate.

=== "Plane of vibration" ===

The principle that refractive index depended on the density of the aether was essential to Fresnel's [[aether drag hypothesis]].<ref>Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{nnbsp}}258–60.</ref> But it could not be extended to birefringent crystals — in which at least one refractive index varies with direction — because density is not directional. Hence his explanation of refraction required a directional variation in [[stiffness]] of the aether ''within'' a birefringent medium, plus a variation in density ''between'' media.<ref>Whittaker, 1910, pp.{{nnbsp}}127,{{tsp}}132–5.</ref>

[[James MacCullagh]] and [[Franz Ernst Neumann]] avoided this complication by supposing that a higher refractive index corresponded always to the same density but a greater elastic ''compliance'' (lower stiffness). To obtain results that agreed with observations on partial reflection, they had to suppose, contrary to Fresnel, that the vibrations were ''within'' the plane of polarization.<ref>Powell, 1856, pp.{{nnbsp}}4–5; Whittaker, 1910, p.{{nnbsp}}149.</ref>

[[File:Portrait of George Gabriel Stokes (1819-1903), Physicist and Mathematician (2551115803).jpg|thumb|left|<div style="text-align: center;">George Gabriel Stokes (1819–1903).</div>]]

The question called for an experimental determination of the direction of vibration, and the challenge was answered by [[Sir George Stokes, 1st Baronet|George Gabriel Stokes]]. He defined the ''plane of vibration'' as "the plane passing through the ray and the direction of vibration"{{r|stokes-1849}} (in agreement with Fig.{{nnbsp}}1). Now suppose that a fine [[diffraction grating]] is illuminated at normal incidence. At large angles of diffraction, the grating will appear somewhat edge-on, so that the directions of vibration will be crowded towards the direction parallel to the plane of the grating. If the planes of polarization coincide with the planes of vibration (as MacCullagh and Neumann said), they will be crowded in the same direction; and if the planes of polarization are ''normal'' to the planes of vibration (as Fresnel said), the planes of polarization will be crowded in the normal direction. To find the direction of the crowding, one could vary the polarization of the incident light in equal steps, and determine the planes of polarization of the diffracted light in the usual manner. Stokes performed such an experiment in 1849, and it found in favor of Fresnel.{{r|stokes-1849}}<ref>Powell, 1856, pp.{{nnbsp}}19–20; Whittaker, 1910, pp.{{nnbsp}}168–9.</ref>

In 1852, Stokes noted a much simpler experiment that leads to the same conclusion. Sunlight scattered from a patch of blue sky 90° from the sun is found, by the methods of Malus, to be polarized in the plane containing the line of sight and the sun. But it is obvious from the geometry that the vibrations of that light can only be perpendicular to that plane.<ref>Whittaker, 1910, pp.{{nnbsp}}169–70.</ref>

There was, however, a sense in which MacCullagh and Neumann were correct. If we attempt an analogy between shear waves in a non-isotropic elastic solid, and EM waves in a magnetically isotropic but electrically non-isotropic crystal, the density must correspond to the magnetic [[permeability (electromagnetism)|permeability]] (both being non-directional), and the compliance must correspond to the electric [[permittivity]] (both being directional). The result is that the velocity of the solid corresponds to the '''H''' field,{{r|carcione-cavallini-1995}} so that the mechanical vibrations of the shear wave are in the direction of the ''magnetic'' vibrations of the EM wave. But Stokes's experiments were bound to detect the ''electric'' vibrations, because those have the greater propensity to interact with matter. In short, the MacCullagh-Neumann vibrations were the ones that had a mechanical analog, but Fresnel's vibrations were the ones that were more likely to be detected in experiments.<ref group=Note>Concerning the limitations of elastic-electromagnetic analogies, see (e.g.) Born & Wolf, 1970, pp.{{nnbsp}}xxiv–xxv; Darrigol, 2012, pp.{{nnbsp}}227–32.</ref>

=== <span id="History meets physics"></span> Modern practice ===

The electromagnetic theory of light further emphasized the ''electric'' vibrations because of their interactions with matter,<ref name=bw28/> whereas the old "plane of polarization" contained the ''magnetic'' vectors. Hence the electromagnetic theory would have reinforced the convention that the vibrations were normal to the plane of polarization — provided, of course, that one was familiar with the historical definition of the plane of polarization. But if one was influenced by physical considerations ''alone'', then, as Feynman{{r|feynman-1963}} and the ''Britannica''{{r|luntz}} illustrate, one would pay attention to the electric vectors and assume that the "plane" of polarization (if one needed such a concept) contained those vectors.

However, it is not clear that a "plane of polarization" is needed at all: knowing what field vectors are involved, one can specify the polarization by specifying the orientation of a particular vector, or, as [[Max Born|Born]] and [[Emil Wolf|Wolf]] suggest, by specifying the "plane of vibration" of that vector.<ref name="bw28"/>&nbsp; [[Eugene Hecht|Hecht]] also prefers the term ''plane of vibration'' (or, more usually, ''plane-of-vibration''), which he defines as the plane of '''E''' and the wave-normal, in agreement with Fig.{{nnbsp}}1 above.<ref>Hecht, 2017, p.{{hsp}}338.</ref>

== Remaining uses ==

In an optically ''[[optical rotation|chiral]]'' medium — that is, one in which the direction of polarization gradually rotates as the wave propagates — the choice of definition of the "plane of polarization" does not affect the existence or direction ("handedness") of the rotation. This is one context in which the ambiguity of the term ''plane of polarization'' causes no further confusion.<ref>Indeed this is the only context in which Hecht (5th Ed., 2017) uses the term ''plane of polarization'' (pp.{{nnbsp}}386,{{tsp}}392).</ref>

There is also a context in which the original definition might still suggest itself. In a non-magnetic non-chiral crystal of the ''[[optic axis of a crystal|biaxial]]'' class (in which there is no ordinary refraction, but both refractions violate [[Snell's law]]), there are three mutually perpendicular planes for which the speed of light is isotropic within the plane provided that the electric vectors are normal to the plane.{{r|jenkins-white-1976}} This situation naturally draws attention to a plane normal to the vibrations as envisaged by Fresnel, and that plane is indeed the plane of polarization as defined by Fresnel or Malus.

In most contexts, however, the concept of a "plane of polarization" distinct from a plane containing the electric "vibrations" has arguably become redundant, and has certainly become a source of confusion. In the words of Born & Wolf, "it is… better not to use this term."<ref>Born & Wolf, 1970, p.{{hsp}}43.</ref>
