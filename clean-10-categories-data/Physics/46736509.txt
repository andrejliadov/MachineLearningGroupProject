The '''Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory''' or "'''Eagleworks Laboratories'''" at [[NASA]]'s [[Johnson Space Center]] is a small research group investigating a variety of theories regarding new forms of [[spacecraft propulsion]]. The principal investigator is Dr. [[Harold G. White]].{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}}

The group is developing the [[White–Juday warp-field interferometer]] in the hope of observing small disturbances of spacetime and also testing small prototypes of thrusters that do not use [[reaction mass]], with currently inconclusive results.{{citation_needed|date=July 2019}} The proposed principle of operation of these [[quantum vacuum plasma thruster]]s, such as the [[RF resonant cavity thruster]] ('EM Drive'),<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2015/04/evaluating-nasas-futuristic-em-drive/|title=Evaluating NASA’s Futuristic EM Drive|date=29 April 2015}}</ref><ref name=":0">{{cite web|url=https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20110023492|title=Eagleworks Laboratories: Advanced Propulsion Physics Research|publisher=NASA}}</ref> has been shown to be inconsistent with known [[laws of physics]], including [[Momentum#Conservation|conservation of momentum]] and [[conservation of energy]].

== Purpose ==
The Advanced Propulsion Physics Laboratory is enabled by section 2.3.7 of the NASA Technology Roadmap TA 2: In Space Propulsion Technologies:<ref>{{Cite web|url=https://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/atoms/files/2015_nasa_technology_roadmaps_ta_2_in-space_propulsion_final.pdf|title=NASA Technology Roadmaps TA 2: In-Space Propulsion Technologies|date=July 2015|website=NASA}}</ref>

{{Quote
|text=Breakthrough Propulsion: Breakthrough propulsion is an area of technology development that seeks to explore and develop a deeper understanding of the nature of space-time, gravitation, inertial frames, quantum vacuum, and other fundamental physical phenomena, with the overall objective of developing advanced propulsion applications and systems that will revolutionize how NASA explores space.
}} 

The lab's purpose is to explore, investigate, and pursue advanced and theoretical propulsion technologies that are intended to allow human exploration of the solar system in the next 50 years with the ultimate goal of interstellar travel by the turn of the century.<ref name=":0" />  The 30x40 ft floor of the lab facility floats on large pneumatic piers in order to isolate it from any seismic activity. The pneumatic piers were originally built for the Apollo program and used to perform work involving [[Inertial measurement unit|inertial measurement units (IMU)]] before being brought out of retirement.   <ref>{{Citation|last=NASA's Ames Research Center|title=Dr. Harold "Sonny" White - Eagleworks Laboratories: Advanced Propulsion|date=2014-11-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wokn7crjBbA|access-date=2019-02-22}}</ref>
