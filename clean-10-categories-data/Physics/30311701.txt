==Biography==
Dalling was born in [[Richmond, New Brunswick]] on February 5, 1854, to Thomas M. and Matilda Jane (Gray) Dalling. In 1878 he moved to Woodstock and established his business, Dalling's Jewellery Store. In 1879 he married Mary Isabella McKilligan and the two had four children.

His store was damaged by fire on February 26, 1891. His losses ($150<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nbcarlet/newspage20.htm|title=Fire Main Street|date=March 7, 1891|work=Carleton Sentinel Newspaper|quote=The losses were as follows : [...] H V Dalling, jeweler, $150;[...]|accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>) were covered by insurance.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nbcarlet/newspage49.htm|title=Newspaper & Documents write-ups about Carleton County People|date=March 2, 1891|work=Press Newspaper|accessdate=28 March 2011|quote=On Thursday night last between the hours of nine and ten o'clock fire was discovered breaking from a building on Main Street, owned by B.B. Manzer. The fire originated in a room occupied by E. M. Campbell, Photographer. The firemen were not long in reaching the scene and soon had the flames under control. Considerable damage was done; however, before the alarm was given.}}</ref>

In 1900, he donated a silver cup, known as the "Dalling Cup", for golf.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nbcarlet/newspage62.htm|title=The Dalling Cup|date=Sep 18, 1905|work=Press Newspaper|quote=The Dalling cup, for the local golf championship, is a very handsome silver cup, engraved, and mounted on an ebony base. The dates for the matches are the first and second Fridays of September in each year. To be owner of the cup it must be won three years in succession. At the present writing the contest is on for ownership. This cup was offered by H V Dalling in 1900, and was won that year by Rev G D Ireland; in 1901 by B M Macleod; in 1902 by Hon W P Jones; in 1903 and 1904 by Clarence Sprague, who is at present leading Winnie Jones by four strokes.|accessdate=28 March 2011|location=Woodstock, New Brunswick}}</ref> Another cup, a gold-lined silver cup, was given in 1905 for the Woodstock Hockey League.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nbcarlet/newspage62.htm|title=Press Newspaper Feb 13, 1905|date=Feb 13, 1905|work=Press Newspaper|quote=The Dalling cup given for the championship of the hockey league is on exhibition at the jewelry store of H V Dalling. It is a gold-lined silver cup, resting on a suitable base. {{sic|?|One}} one side is engraved. "Presented to the winner of the Woodstock Hockey League, by H V Dalling, Winter of 1904 05." The other side is plain, but Mr. Dalling will engrave the winning team and names of players.|accessdate=28 March 2011}}</ref>

His son William Victor Dalling, fought in the First World War as a gunner.<ref>{{cite web|title=Gunner William Victor Dalling|url=http://www.canadiangreatwarproject.com/searches/soldierDetail.asp?Id=67709|work=Canadian Great War Project|accessdate=31 August 2012}}</ref> He was wounded in France on October 13, 1916, but died of pneumonia on October 19, 1918, contracted in Fredericton while waiting for his discharge.<ref name="dalling family"/>

Dalling continued to run his store until 1929, when he retired because of ill health. His daughter, Edith, ran the store until his death on January 6, 1931.

==Telephone==
He is most remembered because of his homemade telephone, which he constructed in 1885 and ran between his home on Richmond St. and his store on Main St. He supported the wires by running them in the branches of trees alongside the streets.<ref>{{cite book|last=Thompson|first=Colleen Whitney|title=Roads to Remember: The Insider's Guide to New Brunswick|year=1994|isbn=0-86492-160-8|page=58}}</ref> Telephones (either wires or instruments) were not yet common in the region.

[[Bell Canada|Bell Telephone]] later investigated his setup and threatened him with a lawsuit for infringing on the company's patent. However, a compromise was reached and Bell opened a small [[telephone exchange]] of twenty lines<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nbcarlet/newsclip.htm|title=First Telephone|quote=The Bell Company opened a small exchange in Mr. Dalling's store, using a twenty line switchboard and Bell instruments, with the Woodstock innovator as agent and manager.|accessdate=28 March 2011|location=Woodstock, New Brunswick}}</ref> in his store, of which he was the manager.<ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.rootsweb.ancestry.com/~nbcarlet/newspage53.htm|title=Newspaper & Documents write-ups about Carleton County People|date=Aug 28, 1885|work=Press Newspaper|quote=The Telephone is now an accomplished fact. By means of this mysterious instrument and wire you can whisper from Upper Woodstock to Lower Corner. The wires from the different places of business all centre at H. V. Dalling's Jewelry Store, which is the Exchange Office. When any one who have the instruments wish to converse with each other they signal the Exchange Office. The attendant there by simple means connects the speaker with the party he wishes to address, and presto ! the talk can go on plainly and easily. To say that this means of communication is one of the wonders of the age is to put it {{sic|midly}}. That the voice, at an ordinary tone, can be distinctly heard for miles by means of a wire is something so mysterious that few can appreciate the fact without themselves having actual cognizance of it.<br /> The wire of which there are about five miles in length, were strung and the instruments placed, under the supervision of S. Hoyt, St. John. J. H. Wagstaff is the manner of the Bell Telephone Company's business in New Brunswick and Nova Scotia. The following are the names of those having instruments connected with the Exchange in Woodstock at present [...]|accessdate=28 March 2011|location=Woodstock, New Brunswick}}</ref> Because there was no service at night or on Sundays, Dalling built and installed a miniature [[Telephone switchboard|switchboard]] of eight lines at his home to answer important messages after hours.
