'''Hyper-radial''' or '''hyperradiant Fresnel lenses''' are [[Fresnel lens]]es used in [[lighthouses]]. They are larger than [[First order Fresnel lens#Sizes of lighthouse lenses|"first-order" lenses]], having a focal length (radius) of 1330&nbsp;mm (52.36 inches). The idea was mentioned by [[Thomas Stevenson]] in 1869<ref name=usls/><!--Wigham won the court case for copyright (patent?) infringement and £2500)--> and first proposed by [[John Richardson Wigham]] in 1872, and again proposed by Thomas Stevenson in 1885 (infringing Wigham's patent).<ref>{{cite journal| title=John Richardson Wigham 1829–1906 | url=http://www.commissionersofirishlights.com/media/35546/Beam_2006.PDF#page=23| publisher=Commissioners of Irish Lights | journal=BEAM | volume=35 | date=2006 | pages=21–22|url-status=dead|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120312014229/http://www.commissionersofirishlights.com/media/35546/Beam_2006.PDF| archivedate=12 March 2012 }}</ref>

The hyper-radial lens was made in 1885 by the [[Barbier, Benard, et Turenne|F. Barbier Company]] in Paris as a test lens for the lighthouse illumination trials then going on at the [[South Foreland Lighthouse]] in the [[United Kingdom]] (UK). [[Chance Brothers]] Glass Company made their first hyper-radial lens in 1887 in the UK.<ref name=usls>{{cite web|title=Hyper-Radial Lenses|url=http://uslhs.org/hyper-radial-lenses|publisher=United States Lighthouse Society|accessdate=2 February 2016}}</ref>

These lenses were originally named biform, and later triform and quadriform lenses, by Wigham. Thomas Stevenson used the term hyperradiant lens, and later they were renamed the hyper-radial lens by James Kenward of the Chance Brothers Glass Company.

The hyper-radial Fresnel lenses were the largest ever put into use and were installed in about two dozen major "landfall" [[beacon]]s around the world. The recipients include [[Makapuu Point Light|Makapu'u Point lighthouse]] on [[Oahu]] Island in [[Hawaii]], [[Cabo de São Vicente]] in [[Portugal]], Manora Point in [[Karachi]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Bishop Rock]] off the coast of [[Cornwall]] (in the UK), Cabo de Santa Marta in [[Brazil]], and [[Cape Race]], [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]].<ref name=usls/> By the 1920s, high-intensity lamp technology had rendered lenses of this size obsolete.

==Lighthouses==
{{Geogroup|section=Lighthouses}}
Hyperradiant optics were installed in thirty-one lighthouses around the world. A large proportion were destined for lights around Great Britain and Ireland, with another four used at sites around Sri Lanka. Despite the improvements in lighting technology, a number are still in use today. Others are in museums, either on display or in storage. The remainder have been broken up or lost.<ref name=usls/><ref name=bness>{{cite web|title=Bullseye lens part from Buchan Ness Lighthouse |url=https://www.goindustrial.co.uk/collections/collection/bullseye-lens-part-from-buchan-ness-lighthouse|publisher=goindustrial.co.uk|accessdate=12 July 2020}}</ref><ref name=flannan>{{cite web|title= Part of a prism from Flannan Isle|url=https://www.goindustrial.co.uk/collections/lighthouses-museum/collection/prism-flannan-isle|publisher=goindustrial.co.uk|accessdate=12 July 2020}}</ref>
