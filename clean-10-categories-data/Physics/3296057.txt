'''Background noise''' or '''ambient noise''' is any [[sound]] other than the sound being monitored (primary sound). Background [[noise]] is a form of [[noise pollution]] or [[interference (communication)|interference]]. Background noise is an important concept in setting noise levels.

Background noises include [[environmental noise]]s such as [[wind waves|water waves]], [[roadway noise|traffic noise]], [[alarm]]s, extraneous [[speech]], [[bioacoustics|bioacoustic noise]] from animals, and electrical noise from devices such as [[refrigerator]]s, [[air conditioning]], [[power supplies]], andÂ [[electric motor|motors]].

The prevention or reduction of background noise is important in the field of [[active noise control]]. It is an important consideration with the use of [[ultrasound]] (e.g. for medical diagnosis or imaging), [[sonar]], and [[sound reproduction]].

==Other uses==
In [[astronomy]], background noise or [[cosmic background radiation]] is [[electromagnetic radiation]] from the sky with no discernible source.

In [[information architecture]], irrelevant, duplicate or incorrect information may be called background noise.

In [[physics]] and [[telecommunication]], background [[signal noise]] can be detrimental or in some cases beneficial. The study of avoiding, reducing or using signal noise is [[information theory]].

In [[telephony]], artificial [[comfort noise]] is used as a substitute for natural background noise, to fill in artificial silence created by [[discontinuous transmission]] systems using [[voice activity detection]].
Background noise can also affect concentration.
