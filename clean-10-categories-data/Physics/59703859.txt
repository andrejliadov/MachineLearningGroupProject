An '''A-center''' is a type of [[crystallographic defect]] complex in [[Silicon]] which consists of a [[vacancy defect]] and an impurity [[Oxygen]] atom.

In general, oxygen in silicon is interstitial, in which the oxygen atom breaks the [[covalent bond]] between two adjacent silicon atoms and is attached in the middle. A-centers - another type of defect, in which oxygen takes the place of the absent silicon atom, that is, it becomes a kind of replacement defect.

The A-center is visible in infrared spectra with a wave length of 12 Î¼m.
