'''Axial ratio''', for any structure or shape with two or more axes, is the [[ratio]] of the length (or magnitude) of those axes to each other - the longer axis divided by the shorter.

In ''chemistry'' or ''materials science'', the axial ratio (symbol P) is used to describe rigid rod-like [[molecule]]s.  It is defined as the length of the rod divided by the rod diameter.

In ''physics'', the axial ratio describes [[electromagnetic radiation]] with elliptical, or circular, [[Polarization (waves)#Parameterization|polarization]].  The [[Elliptical polarization#Axial ratio|axial ratio]] is the ratio of the magnitudes of the major and minor axis defined by the [[electric field vector]].
