A fundamental principle in the field of [[acoustics]], the acoustic approximation states that an acoustic wave is created by a small, adiabatic, pressure [[Capillary wave|ripple]] riding on a comparatively large equilibrium ([[bias]]) [[pressure]]. Typically, the acoustic pressure is on the order of a few ppm of the equilibrium pressure.

By extension, the acoustic approximation also guarantees that an acoustic wave travels at a speed exactly equal to the local [[speed of sound]], such that the [[Mach number]]:
