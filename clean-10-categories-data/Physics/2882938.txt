The '''Beverly Clock'''<ref>{{harvnb|Amon|Beverly|Dodd|1984}}</ref> is a [[clock]] situated in the 3rd floor lift [[foyer]] of the Department of Physics at the [[University of Otago]], [[Dunedin]], [[New Zealand]]. The clock is still running despite never having been manually wound since its construction in 1864 by [[Arthur Beverly]].<ref>{{harvnb|Abrahams|2001}}</ref>

==Operation==
The clock's mechanism is driven by variations in [[atmospheric pressure]], and by daily [[temperature]] variations; of the two, temperature variations are more important. Either causes the [[air]] in a one cubic-[[foot (length)|foot]] (28 litre) air-tight box to expand or contract, which pushes on a [[diaphragm (mechanics)|diaphragm]]. A temperature variation of six degrees [[Fahrenheit]] (3.3&thinsp;K) over the course of each day creates approximately enough pressure to raise a one-[[pound (mass)|pound]] weight by one inch (equivalent to 0.113 Joules or 31 μWh), which drives the clock mechanism.

A similar mechanism in a commercially available clock which operates on the same principle is the [[Atmos clock]], which is manufactured by the Swiss watchmaker [[Jaeger-LeCoultre]].

While the clock has not been wound since it was made by [[Arthur Beverly]] in 1864, it has stopped on a number of occasions, such as when its mechanism needed cleaning or there was a mechanical failure, and when the Physics Department moved to new quarters.  As well, on occasions when the ambient temperature has not fluctuated sufficiently to absorb the requisite amount of energy, the clock will not function. However, after environmental parameters readjust, the clock begins operating again.
