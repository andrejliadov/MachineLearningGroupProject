The following is a list of notable unsolved problems grouped into broad areas of physics.<ref>{{cite book|last=Ginzburg|first=Vitaly L.|title=The physics of a lifetime : reflections on the problems and personalities of 20th century physics|url=https://archive.org/details/physicslifetimer00ginz_439|url-access=limited|year=2001|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=978-3-540-67534-1|pages=[https://archive.org/details/physicslifetimer00ginz_439/page/n14 3]–200}}</ref>

Some of the major [[List of unsolved problems|unsolved problems]] in [[physics]] are theoretical, meaning that existing [[theory|theories]] seem incapable of explaining a certain observed [[phenomenon]] or experimental result. The others are experimental, meaning that there is a difficulty in creating an [[experiment]] to test a proposed theory or investigate a phenomenon in greater detail.<!-- cleanup because of looks like Original Research. Needs objective criteria for what is or is not an unsolved problem. For example list of problems reported in abc or listed by xyz. Similar to [[Hilbert]]'s list, or as listed by [[NASA]]. Suggest cite each one to one of the external links? What are the criteria for reputable source or authority? --><!-- agree with above, hopefully, new grouping will help -->

There are still some questions [[Physics beyond the Standard Model|beyond the Standard Model of physics]], such as the [[strong CP problem]], [[neutrino#Mass|neutrino mass]], [[matter–antimatter asymmetry]], and the nature of [[dark matter]] and [[dark energy]].<ref>{{Cite journal|title = The Unknown Universe: The Origin of the Universe, Quantum Gravity, Wormholes, and Other Things Science Still Can't Explain |journal = Proceedings of the Royal Society of London, Series A|volume = 456|issue = 1999|pages = 1685|last = Hammond|first = Richard|date = 1 May 2008}}</ref><ref name=sym-v2-feb-05>{{Cite web |last1=Womersley |first1=J. |date=February 2005 |title=Beyond the Standard Model |url=http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/pdfs/200502/beyond_the_standard_model.pdf |work=Symmetry Magazine |access-date=23 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071017160238/http://www.symmetrymagazine.org/pdfs/200502/beyond_the_standard_model.pdf |archive-date=17 October 2007 |url-status=dead }}</ref> Another problem lies within the [[Quantum field theory|mathematical framework]] of the Standard Model itself—the Standard Model is inconsistent with that of [[general relativity]], to the point that one or both theories break down under certain conditions (for example within known [[spacetime]] [[Gravitational singularity|singularities]] like the [[Big Bang]] and the [[Black hole#Singularity|centres]] of [[black hole]]s beyond the [[event horizons|event horizon]]).

== General physics/quantum physics ==
* [[Theory of everything]]: Is there a theory which explains the values of all [[fundamental physical constants]], i.e., of all coupling constants, all elementary particle masses and all mixing angles of elementary particles?<ref name="Open Questions">{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/General/open_questions.html|title=Open Questions in Physics|last=Baez|first=John C.|author-link=John C. Baez|date=March 2006|work=Usenet Physics FAQ|publisher=[[University of California, Riverside]]: Department of Mathematics|access-date=7 March 2011}}</ref> Is there a theory which explains why the [[gauge group]]s of the [[standard model]] are as they are, and why observed [[spacetime]] has 3 spatial dimensions and 1 [[temporal dimension]]? Are "fundamental physical constants" really fundamental or do they vary over time? Are any of the fundamental particles in the standard model of particle physics actually composite particles too tightly bound to observe as such at current experimental energies? Are there elementary particles that have not yet been observed, and, if so, which ones are they and what are their properties? Are there [[fifth force|unobserved fundamental forces]]?
* [[Arrow of time]] (e.g. [[entropy (arrow of time)|entropy's arrow of time]]): Why does time have a direction? Why did the universe have such low [[entropy]] in the past, and time correlates with the universal (but not local) increase in entropy, from the past and to the future, according to the [[second law of thermodynamics]]?<ref name="Open Questions" /> Why are [[CP violation]]s observed in certain weak force decays, but not elsewhere? Are CP violations somehow a product of the second law of thermodynamics, or are they a separate arrow of time? Are there exceptions to the principle of [[causality (physics)|causality]]? Is there a single possible past? Is the [[present#Philosophy and science|present]] moment physically distinct from the past and future, or is it merely an emergent property of [[consciousness]]? What links the quantum arrow of time to the thermodynamic arrow?
* [[Interpretation of quantum mechanics]]: How does the [[quantum mechanics|quantum]] description of reality, which includes elements such as the [[quantum superposition|superposition]] of states and [[wavefunction collapse]] or [[quantum decoherence]], give rise to the reality we perceive?<ref name="Open Questions" /> Another way of stating this question regards the [[measurement problem]]: What constitutes a "measurement" which apparently causes the wave function to collapse into a definite state? Unlike classical physical processes, some quantum mechanical processes (such as [[quantum teleportation]] arising from [[quantum entanglement]]) cannot be simultaneously "local", "causal", and "real", but it is not obvious which of these properties must be sacrificed,<ref name=":5">{{Cite book|title=What is Quantum Information?|last=Cabello|first=Adán|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2017|isbn=9781107142114|editor-last=Lombardi|editor-first=Olimpia|pages=138–143|chapter=Interpretations of quantum theory: A map of madness|arxiv=1509.04711|bibcode=2015arXiv150904711C|editor-last2=Fortin|editor-first2=Sebastian|editor-last3=Holik|editor-first3=Federico|editor-last4=López|editor-first4=Cristian|doi=10.1017/9781316494233.009|s2cid=118419619}}</ref> or if an attempt to describe quantum mechanical processes in these senses is a [[category error]] such that a proper understanding of quantum mechanics would render the question meaningless.

== Cosmology and general relativity ==
* [[Problem of time]]: In quantum mechanics time is a classical background parameter and the flow of time is universal and absolute. In general relativity time is one component of four-dimensional spacetime, and the flow of time changes depending on the curvature of spacetime and the spacetime trajectory of the observer. How can these two concepts of time be reconciled?<ref>{{Cite book|title=Integrable Systems, Quantum Groups, and Quantum Field Theories|last=Isham|first=C.

* [[Cosmic inflation]]: Is the theory of cosmic inflation in the very early universe correct, and, if so, what are the details of this epoch? What is the hypothetical {{sic|[[inflaton]]|hide=y|expected=[[inflation]]}} [[scalar field]] that gave rise to this cosmic inflation? If inflation happened at one point, is it [[chaotic inflation|self-sustaining through inflation of quantum-mechanical fluctuations]], and thus ongoing in some extremely distant place?<ref name=podolsky-NEQNET>{{cite web|last=Podolsky|first=Dmitry|title=Top ten open problems in physics|url=http://www.nonequilibrium.net/225-top-ten-open-problems-physics/|publisher=NEQNET|access-date=24 January 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022112323/http://www.nonequilibrium.net/225-top-ten-open-problems-physics|archive-date=22 October 2012|url-status=dead}}</ref>
* [[Horizon problem]]: Why is the distant universe so homogeneous when the [[Big Bang theory]] seems to predict larger measurable [[Anisotropy|anisotropies]] of the night sky than those observed? Cosmological [[inflation (cosmology)|inflation]] is generally accepted as the solution, but are other possible explanations such as a [[variable speed of light]] more appropriate?<ref name=newscientist />
* [[Why is there something rather than nothing?|Origin]] and [[Ultimate fate of the universe|future of the universe]]: [[Big_Bang#Pre–Big_Bang_cosmology|How did the conditions for anything to exist arise?]] Is the universe heading towards a [[Big Freeze]], a [[Big Rip]], a [[Big Crunch]], or a [[Big Bounce]]? Or is it part of an infinitely recurring [[cyclic model]]?
* [[Universe#Size and regions|Size of universe]]: The diameter of the [[observable universe]] is about 93 billion light-years, but what is the size of the whole universe?
* [[Baryon asymmetry]]: Why is there far more [[matter]] than [[antimatter]] in the [[observable universe]]? (This may be solved due to the apparent asymmetry in neutrino-antineutrino oscillations.)<ref name="quantamagazine">[https://www.quantamagazine.org/neutrino-asymmetry-passes-critical-threshold-20200415/]</ref>

Is it the lightest [[superpartner]] (LSP)? Or, do the [[Galaxy rotation curve|phenomena attributed to dark matter]] point not to some form of matter but actually to an [[Modified models of gravity|extension of gravity]]?
* [[Dark energy]]: What is the cause of the observed [[accelerated expansion]] ([[De Sitter universe|de Sitter phase]]) of the universe? Why is the energy density of the dark energy component of the same magnitude as the density of matter at present when the two evolve quite differently over time; could it be simply that we are observing at exactly the [[anthropic principle|right time]]? Is dark energy a pure cosmological constant or are models of [[Quintessence (physics)|quintessence]] such as [[phantom energy]] applicable?
* [[Dark flow]]: Is a non-spherically symmetric gravitational pull from outside the observable universe responsible for some of the observed motion of large objects such as galactic clusters in the universe?
* [[Axis of evil (cosmology)|Axis of evil]]: Some large features of the microwave sky at distances of over 13 billion light years appear to be aligned with both the motion and orientation of the solar system. Is this due to systematic errors in processing, contamination of results by local effects, or an unexplained violation of the [[Copernican principle]]?
* [[Shape of the universe]]: What is the 3-[[manifold]] of [[comoving coordinates|comoving space]], i.e. of a comoving spatial section of the universe, informally called the "shape" of the universe? Neither the curvature nor the topology is presently known, though the curvature is known to be "close" to zero on observable scales. The [[cosmic inflation]] hypothesis suggests that the shape of the universe may be unmeasurable, but, since 2003, [[Jean-Pierre Luminet]], et al., and other groups have suggested that the shape of the universe may be the [[Homology sphere#Cosmology|Poincaré dodecahedral space]]. Is the shape unmeasurable; the Poincaré space; or another 3-manifold?
* The [[List of largest cosmic structures|largest structures]] in the universe are larger than expected. Current cosmological models say there should be very little structure on scales larger than a few hundred million light years across, due to the expansion of the universe trumping the effect of gravity.<ref>Stephen Battersby (21 June 2011). [https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn20597-largest-cosmic-structures-too-big-for-theories/ "Largest cosmic structures 'too big' for theories"]. ''[[New Scientist]]''. Retrieved 5 July 2019</ref> But the [[Sloan Great Wall]] is 1.38 billion [[light-years]] in length. And the largest structure currently known, the [[Hercules–Corona Borealis Great Wall]], is up to 10 billion light-years in length. Are these actual structures or random density fluctuations? If they are real structures, they contradict the '[[W:Observable universe#End of Greatness|End of Greatness]]' hypothesis which asserts that at a scale of 300 million light-years structures seen in smaller surveys are randomized to the extent that the smooth distribution of the universe is visually apparent.
* [[Extra dimensions]]: Does nature have more than four [[spacetime]] dimensions? If so, what is their size? Are dimensions a fundamental property of the universe or an emergent result of other physical laws? Can we experimentally observe evidence of higher spatial dimensions?

Would a consistent theory involve a force mediated by a hypothetical [[graviton]], or be a product of a discrete structure of spacetime itself (as in [[loop quantum gravity]])? Are there deviations from the predictions of general relativity at very small or very large scales or in other extreme circumstances that flow from a quantum gravity mechanism?

If not, and black holes can evaporate away, what happens to the information stored in them (since quantum mechanics does not provide for the destruction of information)? Or does the radiation stop at some point leaving black hole remnants? Is there another way to probe their internal structure somehow, if such a structure [[No hair theorem|even exists]]?
* The [[cosmic censorship hypothesis]] and the [[chronology protection conjecture]]: Can singularities not hidden behind an event horizon, known as "[[naked singularities]]", arise from realistic initial conditions, or is it possible to prove some version of the "cosmic censorship hypothesis" of [[Roger Penrose]] which proposes that this is impossible?<ref>{{Cite news|last=Joshi|first=Pankaj S.|title=Do Naked Singularities Break the Rules of Physics?|magazine=[[Scientific American]]|date=January 2009|url=http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=naked-singularities|archive-url=https://archive.today/20120525044855/http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?id=naked-singularities|url-status=dead|archive-date=2012-05-25}}</ref> Similarly, will the [[closed timelike curve]]s which arise in some solutions to the equations of general relativity (and which imply the possibility of backwards [[time travel]]) be ruled out by a theory of [[quantum gravity]] which unites general relativity with quantum mechanics, as suggested by the "chronology protection conjecture" of [[Stephen Hawking]]?

{{See also|Beyond the Standard Model}}
* [[Hierarchy problem]]: Why is [[gravity]] such a weak force? It becomes strong for particles only at the [[Planck mass|Planck scale]], around 10{{sup|19}} [[GeV]], much above the [[electroweak scale]] (100 GeV, the energy scale dominating physics at low energies). Why are these scales so different from each other? What prevents quantities at the electroweak scale, such as the [[Higgs boson]] mass, from getting [[renormalization|quantum corrections]] on the order of the Planck scale? Is the solution [[supersymmetry]], [[extra dimensions]], or just [[anthropic principle|anthropic]] [[Fine-tuned universe|fine-tuning]]?
* [[Planck particle]]: The Planck mass plays an important role in parts of mathematical physics. A series of researchers have suggested the existence of a fundamental particle with mass equal to or close to that of the Planck mass. The Planck mass is however enormous compared to any detected particle. It is still an unsolved problem if there exist or even have existed a particle with close to the Planck mass. This is indirectly related to the hierarchy problem.

* [[Free neutron decay#Neutron lifetime puzzle|Neutron lifetime puzzle]]: While the neutron lifetime has been studied for decades, there currently exists a lack of [[consilience]] on its exact value, due to different results from two experimental methods ("bottle" versus "beam").<ref>{{cite web |url=https://www.quantamagazine.org/neutron-lifetime-puzzle-deepens-but-no-dark-matter-seen-20180213/ |title=Neutron Lifetime Puzzle Deepens, but No Dark Matter Seen |last=Wolchover |first=Natalie |date=13 February 2018 |website=[[Quanta Magazine]] |access-date=31 July 2018 |quote=When physicists strip neutrons from atomic nuclei, put them in a bottle, then count how many remain there after some time, they infer that neutrons radioactively decay in 14 minutes and 39 seconds, on average. But when other physicists generate beams of neutrons and tally the emerging protons—the particles that free neutrons decay into—they peg the average neutron lifetime at around 14 minutes and 48 seconds. The discrepancy between the “bottle” and “beam” measurements has persisted since both methods of gauging the neutron’s longevity began yielding results in the 1990s. At first, all the measurements were so imprecise that nobody worried. Gradually, though, both methods have improved, and still they disagree.}}</ref>
