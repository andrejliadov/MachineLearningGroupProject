In [[physics]], theories of [[gravitation]] postulate mechanisms of interaction governing the movements of bodies with mass. There have been numerous theories of gravitation since ancient times. The first extant sources discussing such theories are found in [[ancient Greek philosophy]]. This work was furthered by [[History of science and technology in the Indian subcontinent|ancient Indian]] and [[Physics in the medieval Islamic world|medieval Islamic physicists]], before gaining great strides [[History of science in the Renaissance|during the Renaissance]] and [[Scientific Revolution]], culminating in the formulation of [[Newton's law of gravity]]. This was superseded by [[Albert Einstein]]'s [[theory of relativity]] in the early 20th century.

[[Greek philosopher]] [[Aristotle]] ({{fl.|4th century&nbsp;BC}}) believed that objects tend toward a point due to their inner ''gravitas'' (heaviness). [[Vitruvius]] ({{Fl|1st century&nbsp;BC|lk=no}}) understood that objects fall based on their [[specific gravity]]. In the 7th century CE, [[Brahmagupta]] spoke of gravity as an attractive force. The [[Aristotelian physics#Natural place|Aristotelian concept of gravity]] began to be rejected, initially by Islamic physicists, starting in the 11th century with [[Ibn Sina]]'s [[theory of impetus]]. The following century, [[Abu'l-Barakāt al-Baghdādī]] described [[gravitational acceleration]]. The works of Ibn Sina and al-Baghdādī were [[Latin translations of the 12th century|translated into Latin]] by the 14th century, influencing [[Jean Buridan]] and [[Albert of Saxony (philosopher)|Albert of Saxony]]. The same century, [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]'s [[Merton College]] developed the [[mean speed theorem]].

In the early 17th century, [[Galileo Galilei]] found that all objects tend to accelerate equally in [[free fall]]. In 1632, he put forth [[Galilean invariance|the basic principle of relativity]]. The existence of the [[gravitational constant]] was explored by various researchers from the mid-17th century, helping [[Isaac Newton]] formulate his law of universal gravitation. Newton's [[classical mechanics]] were superseded in the early 20th century, when Einstein developed the [[Special relativity|special]] and [[General relativity|general theory of relativity]]. The [[Graviton|force carrier of gravity]] remains an outlier in the search for a [[theory of everything]], which various models of [[quantum gravity]] are candidates for.

The [[Ionian School (philosophy)|Ionian]] [[Greek philosopher]] [[Heraclitus]] ({{Circa|535}}{{Snd}}{{Circa|475&nbsp;BC|lk=no}}) used the word ''[[logos]]'' ('I say') to describe a kind of law which keeps the cosmos in harmony, moving all objects, including the stars, winds, and waves.<ref name=":0">{{cite book|last=Smith|first=Homer W.|url=https://archive.org/details/manhisgods00smit|title=Man and His Gods|publisher=[[Grosset & Dunlap]]|year=1952|location=New York|page=[https://archive.org/details/manhisgods00smit/page/144 144]|author-link=Homer W.

In the 4th century BC, the [[ancient Greece|Greek]] philosopher [[Aristotle]] taught that there is no [[Causality|effect]] or [[Motion (physics)|motion]] without a [[causality|cause]]. The cause of the downward motion of heavy bodies, such as the element [[earth (classical element)|earth]], was related to their [[Nature (philosophy)|nature]], which caused them to move downward toward the centre of the universe, which was their natural place. Conversely, light bodies such as the element [[Fire (classical element)|fire]], move by their nature upward toward the inner surface of the [[Celestial spheres|sphere]] of the Moon.  Thus in Aristotle's system heavy bodies are not attracted to the [[Earth]] by an external force, but tend toward the centre of the universe because of an inner ''gravitas'' or heaviness.<ref>Edward Grant, ''The Foundations of Modern Science in the Middle Ages'', (Cambridge: Cambridge Univ.

<blockquote>If the [[Mercury (element)|quicksilver]] is poured into a vessel, and a stone weighing one hundred pounds is laid upon it, the stone swims on the surface, and cannot depress the liquid, nor break through, nor separate it. If we remove the hundred pound weight, and put on a scruple of gold, it will not swim, but will sink to the bottom of its own accord. Hence, it is undeniable that the gravity of a substance depends not on the amount of its weight, but on its nature.<ref>

In the 6th century CE, the Byzantine [[Alexandria]]n scholar [[John Philoponus]] proposed the [[theory of impetus]], which modifies Aristotle's theory that "continuation of motion depends on continued action of a force" by incorporating a causative force which diminishes over time.

Another 11th-century Persian polymath, [[Al-Biruni]], proposed that [[Astronomical object|heavenly bodies]] have mass, weight, and gravity, just like the Earth. He criticized both Aristotle and Ibn Sina for holding the view that heavenly bodies lack these properties and that only the Earth has mass, weight and gravity.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Starr |first1=S.

They also founded the theory of [[Ponderable mass|ponderable]] [[lever]], and created the science of gravity.

In one of his proofs, he shows that the distance elapsed by an object dropped from a spinning wheel will increase proportionally to the square of the wheel's rotation time.{{Sfn|Gillispie|1960|p=121}} In 1671, [[Robert Hooke]] speculated that gravitation is the result of bodies emitting waves in the [[aether theories|aether]].<ref>{{cite journal|last=Taylor|first=William Bower |title =Kinetic Theories of Gravitation|journal = Smithsonian Report|year=1876 |pages=205–282|title-link =s:Kinetic Theories of Gravitation}}</ref>{{efn|[[James Challis]] repeated this assumption in 1869.}} [[Nicolas Fatio de Duillier]] (1690) and [[Georges-Louis Le Sage]] (1748) proposed [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|a corpuscular model]] using some sort of screening or shadowing mechanism. In 1784, Le Sage posited that gravity could be a result of the collision of atoms, and in the early 19th century, he expanded [[Daniel Bernoulli]]'s [[Hydrodynamica|theory of corpuscular pressure]] to the universe as a whole.{{sfn|Gillispie|1960|p=480}} A similar model was later created by [[Hendrik Lorentz]]&nbsp;(1853–1928), who used [[electromagnetic radiation]] instead of corpuscles.

English mathematician [[Isaac Newton]] utilized Descartes' argument that curvilinear motion constrains inertia,{{sfn|Gillispie|1960|p=120}} and in 1675, argued that aether streams attract all bodies to one another.{{efn|[[Bernhard Riemann]] made a similar argument in 1853.}} Newton&nbsp;(1717) and [[Leonhard Euler]]&nbsp;(1760) proposed a model in which the aether loses density near mass, leading to a net force acting on bodies.{{citation needed|date=October 2019}} Further mechanical explanations of gravitation (including [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|Le Sage's theory]]) were created between 1650 and 1900 to explain Newton's theory, but mechanistic models eventually fell out of favor because most of them lead to an unacceptable amount of drag (air resistance), which was not observed. Others violate the [[energy conservation law]] and are incompatible with modern [[thermodynamics]].<ref>{{Cite journal | author =Zenneck, J. | author-link =Jonathan Zenneck | title =Gravitation | journal =Encyklopädie der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen | volume =5 | issue =1 | pages =25–67 | date =1903 | place =Leipzig | doi =10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 | isbn =978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref>

===Newton's law===
{{Main|Newton's law of universal gravitation|Gauss's law for gravity}}
In 1679, Robert Hooke wrote to Isaac Newton of his hypothesis concerning orbital motion which partly depends on an [[inverse-square]] force.<ref>{{Cite book| publisher = Cambridge University Press| isbn = 978-0-521-65696-2| last = Cohen| first = I. Bernard|author2=George Edwin Smith| title = The Cambridge Companion to Newton| date = 2002|pages = 11–12}}</ref> As a result, Newton was able to mathematically derive [[Kepler's laws of planetary motion]], including the elliptical orbits for the six then-known planets and the Moon. In 1687, Newton published ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]'', which hypothesizes the inverse-square law of universal gravitation. In his own words:<blockquote>I deduced that the forces which keep the planets in their orbs must be reciprocally as the squares of their distances from the centres about which they revolve; and thereby compared the force requisite to keep the moon in her orb with the force of gravity at the surface of the earth; and found them to answer pretty nearly.</blockquote>

Newton's original formula was:
:<math>{\rm Force\,of\,gravity} \propto \frac{\rm mass\,of\,object\,1\,\times\,mass\,of\,object\,2}{\rm distance\,from\,centers^2}</math>

where the symbol <math>\propto</math> means "is proportional to". To make this into an equal-sided formula or equation, there needed to be a multiplying factor or constant that would give the correct force of gravity no matter the value of the masses or distance between them (the gravitational constant). Newton would need an accurate measure of this constant to prove his inverse-square law. This was [[Cavendish experiment|first performed]] by [[Henry Cavendish]] in 1797.{{efn|Many sources incorrectly state that this was the first measurement of ''G'' (or the Earth's density).<ref>{{Cite book|last = Feynman|first = Richard P.|publisher = California Institute of Technology|isbn = 9780465025626|location = Pasadena, California|url = http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html#Ch1-S1|series = The Feynman lectures on physics|volume = Volume I|title = mainly mechanics, radiation and heat|publication-date = 2013|year = 1963|chapter-url = http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_07.html|chapter = 7.

In Newton's theory<ref>{{cite book|last=Newton|first=I.|author-link=Isaac Newton|year=1686|title=[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]|language=la}}</ref> (rewritten using more modern mathematics) the density of mass <math>\rho\,</math> generates a scalar field, the gravitational potential <math>\varphi\,</math> in joules per kilogram, by

Using the [[Nabla operator]] <math>\nabla</math> for the [[gradient]] and [[divergence]] (partial derivatives), this can be conveniently written as:
:<math>\nabla^2 \varphi = 4 \pi G \rho \,.</math>

This scalar field governs the motion of a [[free-fall]]ing particle by:
:<math>{ d^2x^j\over dt^2} = -{\partial\varphi\over\partial x^j\,}.</math>

At distance ''r'' from an isolated mass ''M'', the scalar field is
:<math>\varphi = -\frac{GM} r \,.</math>
Failing to define a medium in which it interacted, Newton's theory seemed to require [[action at a distance]].{{Sfn|Gillispie|1960|p=144}} His theory, and [[Joseph-Louis Lagrange]]'s improvement on the calculation (applying the variational principle), do not take into account [[Relativistic mechanics|relativistic]] effects, which were unknown at that time. Even so, Newton's theory is thought to be exceptionally accurate in the limit of weak [[gravitational field]]s and low speeds.

Newton's theory enjoyed its greatest success when it was used to predict the existence of [[Neptune]] based on motions of [[Uranus]] that could not be accounted by the actions of the other planets. Calculations by [[John Couch Adams]] and [[Urbain Le Verrier]] both predicted the general position of the planet. Le Verrier sent his position to [[Johann Gottfried Galle]], asking him to verify. The same night, Galle spotted Neptune near the position Le Verrier had predicted.<ref name="eb">{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Adams, John Couch|volume=1|pages=177–178}}</ref>

==Modern era==
{{see also|Alternatives to general relativity}}
[[Albert Einstein]] developed his [[theory of relativity]] in papers published in 1905 and 1915. In 1914, [[Gunnar Nordström]] attempted to unify gravity and [[electromagnetism]] in [[Nordström's theory of gravitation|his theory]] of [[Five-dimensional space|five-dimensional]] gravitation.{{efn|In [[string theory]], dimensions exceeding four allow for the existence of [[Multiverse|parallel realities]]—which along with the [[anthropic principle]], help to explain the statistical near-impossibility of our [[fine-tuned universe]].}} In 1919, general relativity superseded all other gravitational models, including Newton's laws, when [[gravitational lens]]ing around a solar eclipse matching Einstein's equations was observed by [[Arthur Eddington]]. Thereafter, German mathematician [[Theodor Kaluza]] promoted the idea of general relativity with a fifth dimension, which in 1921 Swedish physicist [[Oskar Klein]] gave [[Kaluza–Klein theory|a physical interpretation]] of in a prototypical [[string theory]], a possible model of [[quantum gravity]] and potential theory of everything.

[[Einstein's field equations]] include a [[cosmological constant]] to account for the alleged [[static universe|staticity of the universe]]. However, [[Edwin Hubble]] observed in 1929 that the universe appears to be expanding. By the 1930s, [[Paul Dirac]] developed the hypothesis that gravitation should slowly and steadily decrease over the course of the history of the universe.<ref>{{cite book |first=Heinz|last=Haber|title=Unser blauer Planet |trans-title=Our blue planet |edition=Rororo Taschenbuch Ausgabe [Rororo pocket edition] |series=Rororo Sachbuch [Rororo nonfiction]  |date=1967 |orig-year=1965 |publisher=[[Rowohlt Verlag]] |location=Reinbek |language=de |page=52 |trans-chapter=The expansion of the Earth |chapter=Die Expansion der Erde |quote=Der englische Physiker und Nobelpreisträger Dirac hat ... vor über dreißig Jahren die Vermutung begründet, dass sich das universelle Maß der Schwerkraft im Laufe der Geschichte des Universums außerordentlich langsam, aber stetig verringert."

In 1922, [[Jacobus Kapteyn]] proposed the existence of [[dark matter]], an unseen force that moves stars in galaxies at higher velocities than gravity alone accounts for. It was found in 2013 to have comprised 26.8% of the early universe.<ref name="Washington Post"/> Along with dark energy, dark matter is an outlier in Einstein's relativity, and an explanation for its apparent effects is a requirement for a successful theory of everything.

In 1957, [[Hermann Bondi]] proposed that [[Negative mass|negative gravitational mass]] (combined with negative inertial mass) would comply with the [[strong equivalence principle]] of general relativity and [[Newton's laws of motion]]. Bondi's proof yielded [[gravitational singularity|singularity]]-free solutions for the relativity equations.<ref name="Bondi">{{cite journal | last1 = Bondi | first1 = H. | date = 1957 | title = Negative mass in general relativity | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 423–428 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.29.423|bibcode = 1957RvMP...29..423B }}</ref>

Early theories of gravity attempted to explain planetary orbits (Newton) and more complicated orbits (e.g. Lagrange). Then came unsuccessful attempts to [[Le Sage's theory of gravitation|combine gravity and either wave or corpuscular theories]] of gravity. The whole landscape of physics was changed with the discovery of [[Lorentz transformations]], and this led to attempts to reconcile it with gravity. At the same time, experimental physicists started testing the foundations of gravity and relativity – [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariance]], the [[Tests of general relativity|gravitational deflection of light]], the [[Eötvös experiment]]. These considerations led to and past the development of [[general relativity]].

===Electrostatic models (1870–1900)===
At the end of the 19th century, many tried to combine Newton's force law with the established laws of electrodynamics, like those of [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Weber]], [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]], [[Bernhard Riemann]] and [[James Clerk Maxwell]]. Those models were used to explain the [[Tests of general relativity#Perihelion precession of Mercury|perihelion precession of Mercury]]. In 1890, Lévy succeeded in doing so by combining the laws of Weber and Riemann, whereby the [[speed of gravity]] is equal to the speed of light in his theory. And in another attempt, [[Paul Gerber]] (1898) even succeeded in deriving the correct formula for the Perihelion shift (which was identical to that formula later used by Einstein). However, because the basic laws of Weber and others were wrong (for example, Weber's law was superseded by Maxwell's theory), those hypotheses were rejected.<ref>{{cite book|author=Zenneck, J. |author-link=Jonathan Zenneck |chapter=Gravitation |journal=Encyklopädie der Mathematischen Wissenschaften mit Einschluss Ihrer Anwendungen |date=1903 |volume=5 |pages=25–67 |language=de |doi=10.1007/978-3-663-16016-8_2 |isbn=978-3-663-15445-7 }}</ref> In 1900, [[Hendrik Lorentz]] tried to explain gravity on the basis of his [[Lorentz ether theory]] and the [[Maxwell equations]]. He assumed, like [[Ottaviano Fabrizio Mossotti]] and [[Johann Karl Friedrich Zöllner]], that the attraction of opposite charged particles is stronger than the repulsion of equal charged particles. The resulting net force is exactly what is known as universal gravitation, in which the speed of gravity is that of light. But Lorentz calculated that the value for the perihelion advance of Mercury was much too low.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Lorentz, H.A. | author-link = Hendrik Lorentz | title=Considerations on Gravitation | journal=Proceedings of the Royal Netherlands Academy of Arts and Sciences (KNAW) | date=1900 | volume=2 | pages=559–574 | url=https://www.dwc.knaw.nl/DL/publications/PU00014433.pdf}}</ref>

In the late 19th century, [[Lord Kelvin]] pondered the possibility of a [[theory of everything]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Thompson|first=Silvanus P.|date=2019|title=Lord Kelvin|url=https://www.iec.ch/about/history/figures/lord_kelvin.htm|accessdate=October 16, 2019|website=International Electrotechnical Commission}}</ref> He proposed that every body pulsates, which might be an explanation of gravitation and [[electric charge]]s. However, his ideas were largely mechanistic and required the existence of the aether, which the [[Michelson–Morley experiment]] failed to detect in 1887. This, combined with [[Mach's principle]], led to gravitational models which feature action at a distance.

===Lorentz-invariant models (1905–1910)===
Based on the [[principle of relativity]], [[Henri Poincaré]] (1905, 1906), [[Hermann Minkowski]] (1908), and [[Arnold Sommerfeld]] (1910) tried to modify Newton's theory and to establish a [[Lorentz covariance|Lorentz invariant]] gravitational law, in which the speed of gravity is that of light. As in Lorentz's model, the value for the perihelion advance of Mercury was much too low.<ref>{{cite journal | author=Walter, S. | date=2007 | editor=Renn, J. | title= Breaking in the 4-vectors: the four-dimensional movement in gravitation, 1905–1910 | url= http://scottwalter.free.fr/papers/breaking2007.pdf | journal=The Genesis of General Relativity |pages=193–252 |volume=3 |place=Berlin |bibcode=2007ggr..conf..193W}}</ref>

===Einstein (1905, 1908, 1912)===
In 1905, Albert Einstein published a series of papers in which he established the [[special theory of relativity]] and the fact that [[Mass–energy equivalence|mass and energy are equivalent]]. In 1907, in what he described as "the happiest thought of my life", Einstein realized that someone who is in free fall experiences no gravitational field. In other words, gravitation is exactly equivalent to acceleration.

By then he knew of the gravitational redshift and the deflection of light. He had realized that [[Lorentz transformations]] are not generally applicable, but retained them. The theory states that the speed of light is constant in free space but varies in the presence of matter. The theory was only expected to hold when the source of the gravitational field is stationary. It includes the [[principle of least action]]:

:<math>\delta \int d\tau = 0\,</math>

:<math>{d\tau}^2 = - \eta_{\mu \nu} \, dx^\mu \, dx^\nu \,</math>

where <math>\eta_{\mu \nu} \,</math> is the [[Minkowski space|Minkowski metric]], and there is a summation from 1 to 4 over indices <math>\mu \,</math> and <math>\nu \,</math>.

Einstein and Grossmann<ref name=Einstein1913>Einstein, A. and Grossmann, M. (1913), ''Zeitschrift für Mathematik und Physik'' 62, 225</ref> includes [[Riemannian geometry]] and [[Covariant transformation|tensor calculus]].

:<math>\delta \int d\tau = 0 \,</math>

:<math>{d\tau}^2 = - g_{\mu \nu} \, dx^\mu \, dx^\nu \,</math>

The equations of [[Classical electromagnetism|electrodynamics]] exactly match those of general relativity. The equation

:<math>T^{\mu \nu} = \rho {dx^\mu \over d\tau} {dx^\nu \over d\tau} \,</math>

is not in general relativity. It expresses the [[stress–energy tensor]] as a function of the matter density.

===Abraham (1912)===
While this was going on, [[Max Abraham|Abraham]] was developing an alternative model of gravity in which the speed of light depends on the gravitational field strength and so is variable almost everywhere. Abraham's 1914 review of gravitation models is said to be excellent, but his own model was poor.

:<math>g_{\mu \nu} = \psi^2 \eta_{\mu \nu} \,</math>

they relate Einstein–Grossmann<ref name=Einstein1913 /> to Nordström.<ref name=Nordström1913 /> They also state:

:<math>T \, \propto \, R \,.</math>

That is, the trace of the stress energy tensor is proportional to the curvature of space.

Between 1911 and 1915, Einstein developed the idea that gravitation is equivalent to acceleration, initially stated as the [[equivalence principle]], into his general theory of relativity, which fuses the [[Three-dimensional space|three dimensions of space]] and the one dimension of [[time]] into the [[four-dimensional]] fabric of [[spacetime]]. However, it does not unify gravity with [[quantum|quanta]]—individual particles of energy, which Einstein himself had postulated the existence of in 1905.

===General relativity===
{{Main|Introduction to general relativity}}
[[File:1919 Eclipse expedition to test relativity.jpg|thumb|Illustration explaining the relevance of the total [[solar eclipse of 29 May 1919]], from the 22 November 1919 edition of ''[[The Illustrated London News]]'']]

In general relativity, the effects of gravitation are ascribed to spacetime curvature instead of to a force. The starting point for general relativity is the equivalence principle, which equates free fall with inertial motion. The issue that this creates is that free-falling objects can accelerate with respect to each other. To deal with this difficulty, Einstein proposed that spacetime is curved by matter, and that free-falling objects are moving along [[Geodesics in general relativity|locally straight paths in curved spacetime]]. More specifically, Einstein and [[David Hilbert]] discovered the [[field equation]]s of general relativity, which relate the presence of matter and the curvature of spacetime. [[Einstein field equations|These field equations]] are a set of 10 [[simultaneous equation|simultaneous]], [[Nonlinearity|non-linear]], [[differential equation]]s. The solutions of the field equations are the components of the [[metric tensor (general relativity)|metric tensor]] of spacetime, which describes its geometry. The geodesic paths of spacetime are calculated from the metric tensor.

Notable solutions of the Einstein field equations include:
* The [[Schwarzschild solution]], which describes spacetime surrounding a [[spherical symmetry|spherically symmetrical]] non-rotating uncharged massive object. For objects with radii smaller than the [[Schwarzschild radius]], this solution generates a [[black hole]] with a central singularity.
* The [[Reissner–Nordström black hole|Reissner–Nordström solution]], in which the central object has an electrical charge. For charges with a [[geometrized]] length less than the geometrized length of the mass of the object, this solution produces black holes with an [[event horizon]] surrounding a [[Cauchy horizon]].
* The [[Kerr solution]] for rotating massive objects. This solution also produces black holes with multiple horizons.
* The [[physical cosmology|cosmological]] [[Robertson–Walker coordinates|Robertson–Walker solution]], which predicts the expansion of the universe.

General relativity has enjoyed much success because its predictions (not called for by older theories of gravity) have been regularly confirmed.  For example:
* General relativity accounts for the anomalous perihelion precession of Mercury.<ref name="Ein1916" />
* Gravitational lensing was first confirmed in 1919, and has more recently been strongly confirmed through the use of a [[quasar]] which passes behind the Sun as seen from the Earth.
* The expansion of the universe (predicted by the [[Robertson–Walker metric]]) was confirmed by Edwin Hubble in 1929.
* The prediction that time runs slower at lower potentials has been confirmed by the [[Pound–Rebka experiment]], the [[Hafele–Keating experiment]], and the [[GPS]].
* The [[time delay of light]] passing close to a massive object was first identified by [[Irwin Shapiro]] in 1964 in interplanetary spacecraft signals.
* [[Gravitational radiation]] has been indirectly confirmed through studies of binary [[pulsar]]s such as [[PSR 1913+16]].

===Quantum gravity===
{{Main|Quantum gravity}}
Several decades after the discovery of general relativity, it was realized that it cannot be the complete theory of gravity because it is incompatible with [[quantum mechanics]].<ref name="Randall, Lisa 2005">{{cite book | author=Randall, Lisa | title=Warped Passages: Unraveling the Universe's Hidden Dimensions | url=https://archive.org/details/warpedpassagesun00rand_1 | url-access=registration | publisher=Ecco | date=2005 | id=ISBN}}</ref> Later it was understood that it is possible to describe gravity in the framework of [[quantum field theory]] like the other [[fundamental forces]]. In this framework, the attractive force of gravity arises due to exchange of [[virtual particle|virtual]] [[graviton]]s, in the same way as the electromagnetic force arises from exchange of virtual [[photon]]s.<ref>{{cite book |last= Feynman |first= R.

Moreover, this approach fails at short distances of the order of the [[Planck length]].<ref name="Randall, Lisa 2005"/>

Theoretical models such as string theory and [[loop quantum gravity]] are current candidates for a possible 'theory of everything'.
