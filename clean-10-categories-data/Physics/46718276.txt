'''Aggregation-induced emission''' (AIE) is an abnormal phenomenon that is observed with certain [[organic compound|organic]] [[luminophore]]s (fluorescent dyes).<ref name="HongLam2011">{{cite journal |last1=Hong |first1=Yuning |last2=Lam |first2=Jacky W.

Most [[organic compounds]] have [[plane (geometry)|planar]] structures and higher [[photoemission]] efficiencies in [[solution (chemistry)|solution]] than in the [[solid (state of matter)|solid]] state.  Otherwise said, these fluorophores or fluorescent dyes are much more emissive in solution compared to just the solid form, in that the intensity of their emission is greater in solution. However, some organic luminophores have freely-rotating groups (rotational degrees of freedom), when these molecules are excited instead of releasing that energy as light they relax back down through these rotations.  When these luminophores aggregate or [[crystallization|crystallize]], which restricts those rotations, they can become very fluorescent or emissive, and the photoluminescence efficiency (i.e. quantum yield) increases.


==Aggregation-induced emission enhancement==
The phenomenon in which organic luminophores show higher photoluminescence efficiency in the aggregated state than in solution is called aggregation-induced emission enhancement (AIEE). Some luminophores, e.g., [[Diketopyrrolopyrrole dye|diketopyrrolopyrrole]]-based and [[sulfonamide]]-based luminophores, only display enhanced emission upon entering the crystalline state. That is, these luminophores are said to exhibit crystallization-induced emission enhancement (CIEE).<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Jin |first1=Yi |last2=Xu |first2=Yanbin |last3=Liu |first3=Yinling |last4=Wang |first4=Lingyun |last5=Jiang |first5=Huanfeng |last6=Li |first6=Xianjie |last7=Cao |first7=Derong |title=Synthesis of novel diketopyrrolopyrrole-based luminophores showing crystallization-induced emission enhancement properties |journal=Dyes and Pigments |date=September 2011 |volume=90 |issue=3 |pages=311–318 |doi=10.1016/j.dyepig.2011.01.005 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |last1=Virk |first1=Tarunpreet Singh |last2=Ilawe |first2=Niranjan V. |last3=Zhang |first3=Guoxian |last4=Yu |first4=Craig P. |last5=Wong |first5=Bryan M. |last6=Chan |first6=Julian M.

==Aggregation-induced emission Polymer==
Fluorescence-emission Polymer is a kind of polymer which can absorb light of certain frequency and then give out light.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Han |first1=Ting |last2=Deng |first2=Haiqin |last3=Qiu |first3=Zijie |last4=Zhao |first4=Zheng |last5=Zhang |first5=Haoke |last6=Zou |first6=Hang |last7=Leung |first7=Nelson L.

Due to their high biocapacity and fluorescence, they can help researchers to find and mark the location of proteins. And polymers with property of aggregation-induced emission can also help to protect the healthy tissues from the harm of the medicines.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Sun |first1=Wenjing |last2=Luo |first2=Li |last3=Feng |first3=Yushuo |last4=Cai |first4=Yuting |last5=Zhuang |first5=Yixi |last6=Xie |first6=Rong-Jun |last7=Chen |first7=Xiaoyuan |last8=Chen |first8=Hongmin |title=Aggregation-Induced Emission Gold Clustoluminogens for Enhanced Low-Dose X-ray-Induced Photodynamic Therapy |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |date=5 September 2019 |volume=59 |issue=25 |pages=9914–9921 |doi=10.1002/anie.201908712 |pmid=31418982 }}</ref>
