The '''POISK Centre''' (in [[Russian language|Russian]]:''Центр «ПОИСК»'') is an educational and research organization founded in 2004 at [[Saint Petersburg State University]] ([[Russia]]). Its primary aim is to encourage secondary school students and university students to do independent [[scientific research]].

The POISK Centre supports educational programs that motivate youth to develop an interest in [[physics]] and [[natural sciences]], and to involve them in “what a real scientist does” as early as possible. These activities include tight collaboration with leading universities and secondary schools in Russia and abroad, joint seminars and workshops, regular international scientific conferences, language programs, but also the promotion of research competitions, such as the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament|Young Physicists' Tournament]].

POISK means ‘search’ in [[Russian language|Russian]], but it is also a Russian abbreviation for the Support Centre for Olympiads and Intellectual Competitions.

Since 2004, the POISK Centre is the only university-based organization in Russia that is being selecting, supervising and preparing the National team that represents Russia at the [[International Young Physicists' Tournament]].
