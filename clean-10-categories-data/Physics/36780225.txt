The '''IUPAC/IUPAP Joint Working Party''' is a group convened periodically by the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) and the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Physics]] (IUPAP) to consider claims for discovery and naming of new [[chemical element]]s.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.iupac.org/news/news-detail/article/discovery-of-elements-with-atomic-number-z-112.html |title=Discovery of Elements with Atomic Number Z > 112 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120824210301/http://www.iupac.org/news/news-detail/article/discovery-of-elements-with-atomic-number-z-112.html |archivedate=2012-08-24 }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=https://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/2012/pdf/8407x1669.pdf |title=Names and symbols of the elements with atomic numbers 114 and 116 (IUPAC Recommendations 2012) }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal |url=http://stage.iupac.org/objID/Article/pac7510x1601 |title=On the Claims for Discovery of Elements 110, 111, 112, 114, 116, and 118 (IUPAC Technical Report) |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140113200624/http://stage.iupac.org/objID/Article/pac7510x1601 |archivedate=2014-01-13 }}</ref> It is sometimes called the Joint Working Party on Discovery of Elements.<ref>{{cite journal |url=http://iupac.org/publications/pac/pdf/2011/pdf/8307x1485.pdf |title=Discovery of the elements with atomic numbers greater than or equal to 113 (IUPAC Technical Report) }}</ref> The working party's recommendations are voted on by the General Assembly of the IUPAP.<ref>{{cite web |url=http://chemistry.about.com/b/2011/11/06/three-new-elements-are-named.htm |title=Three New Elements Are Named }}</ref>
