{{for|the award given by the American government|Enrico Fermi Award}}

The '''Enrico Fermi Prize''', first awarded in 2001, is given by the [[Italian Physical Society]] (Società Italiana di Fisica).  It is a yearly award of EUR 30,000 honoring one or more Members of the Society who have "particularly honoured physics with their discoveries."<ref name=EnricoFermiItaly>{{cite news|title=Italian Physical Society "Enrico Fermi" Prize|url=http://en.sif.it/activities/fermi_award}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|title=Italians awarded "Enrico Fermi" Prize|url=https://www.researchitaly.it/en/understanding/press-media/news/italians-awarded-enrico-fermi-prize/}}</ref>
