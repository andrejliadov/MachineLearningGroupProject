[[File:Jj-thomson3.jpg|thumb|[[J. J. Thomson]], who won the first Hughes Medal in 1902 <!-- "for his numerous contributions to electric science, especially in reference to the phenomena of electric discharge in gases" -->]]
The '''Hughes Medal''' is awarded by the [[Royal Society of London]] "in recognition of an original discovery in the physical sciences, particularly electricity and magnetism or their applications".<ref name="rs">{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?tip=1&id=1768 |title=The Hughes Medal (1902) |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=2009-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609083941/http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?tip=1&id=1768 |archivedate=9 June 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> Named after [[David E. Hughes]], the medal is awarded with a gift of Â£1000. The medal was first awarded in 1902 to [[J. J. Thomson]] "for his numerous contributions to electric science, especially in reference to the phenomena of electric discharge in gases", and has since been awarded over one-hundred times. <!-- The only year in which no medal was awarded was 1924; the Royal Society have not provided a reason for the lack of an award. --> Unlike other [[Awards, lectures and medals of the Royal Society#Medals|Royal Society medals]], the Hughes Medal has never been awarded to the same individual more than once.

The medal has on occasion been awarded to multiple people at a time; in 1938 it was won by [[John Cockcroft]] and [[Ernest Walton]] "for their discovery that nuclei could be disintegrated by artificially produced bombarding particles",<ref name="tstcrr">{{cite web|url=http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1770 |title=Hughes archive winners 1989 - 1902 |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=2009-02-05 |url-status=dead |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609135151/http://royalsociety.org/page.asp?id=1770 |archivedate=9 June 2008 |df=dmy }}</ref> in 1981 by [[Peter Higgs]] and [[Tom W.
