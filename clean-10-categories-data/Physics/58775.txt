He experimented with and noted the different character of electrical and magnetic forces. In addition to known ancient Greeks' observations of the electrical properties of rubbed amber, he experimented with a needle balanced on a pivot, and found that the needle was non-directionally affected by many materials such as alum, arsenic, hard resin, [[Jet (lignite)|jet]], glass, gum-mastic, mica, rock-salt, sealing wax, slags, sulfur, and precious stones such as amethyst, [[beryl]], diamond, opal, and sapphire. He noted that electrical charge could be stored by covering the body with a non-conducting substance such as silk. He described the method of artificially magnetizing iron. His [[terrella]] (little earth), a sphere cut from a lodestone on a metal lathe, modeled the earth as a lodestone (magnetic iron ore) and demonstrated that every lodestone has fixed poles, and how to find them.<ref>{{cite book |first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=2 |url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeII/chap18.html |chapter=Part IV.

He experimented with such physical models in an attempt to explain problems in [[navigation]] due varying properties of the [[magnetic compass]] with respect to their location on the earth, such as [[magnetic declination]] and magnetic inclination. His experiments explained the [[Dip circle|dipping of the needle]] by the magnetic attraction of the earth, and were used to predict where the vertical dip would be found. Such magnetic inclination was described as early as the 11th century by [[Shen Kuo]] in his ''Meng Xi Bi Tan'' and further investigated in 1581 by retired mariner and [[Compasssmith|compass maker]] [[Robert Norman]], as described in his pamphlet, ''The Newe Attractive.'' The gilbert, a unit of [[magnetomotive force]] or [[magnetic scalar potential]], was named in his honor.

* 1732 &mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] Shows that all objects, except metals, animals, and liquids, can be electrified by rubbing them and that metals, animals and liquids could be electrified by means of an electrostatic generators
* 1734 &mdash; [[C. F. du Fay|Charles François de Cisternay DuFay]] (inspired by Gray's work to perform electrical experiments) dispels the effluvia theory by his paper in Volume 38 of the ''Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society'', describing his discovery of the distinction between two kinds of electricity: "resinous", produced by rubbing bodies such as amber, copal, or [[Lac|gum-lac]] with silk or paper, and "vitreous", by rubbing bodies as glass, rock crystal, or precious stones with hair or wool. He also posited the principle of mutual attraction for unlike forms and the repelling of like forms and that "from this principle one may with ease deduce the explanation of a great number of other phenomena." The terms resinous and vitreous were later replaced with the terms "positive" and "negative" by [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]] and Benjamin Franklin.
* 1737 &mdash; [[C. F. du Fay]] and [[Francis Hauksbee the younger]]{{citation needed|date=May 2013}} independently discover two kinds of frictional electricity: one generated from rubbing glass, the other from rubbing resin (later identified as positive and negative electrical charges).
* 1740 &mdash; [[Jean le Rond d'Alembert]], in ''Mémoire sur la réfraction des corps solides'', explains the process of [[refraction]].
* 1745 &mdash; [[Pieter van Musschenbroek]] of Leiden (Leyden) independently discovers the [[Leyden jar|Leyden (Leiden) jar]], a primitive [[capacitor]] or "condenser" (term coined by Volta in 1782, derived from the Italian ''condensatore''), with which the transient electrical energy generated by current friction machines could now be stored. He and his student Andreas Cunaeus used a glass jar filled with water into which a brass rod had been placed. He charged the jar by touching a wire leading from the electrical machine with one hand while holding the outside of the jar with the other. The energy could be discharged by completing an external circuit between the brass rod and another conductor, originally his hand, placed in contact with the outside of the jar. He also found that if the jar were placed on a piece of metal on a table, a shock would be received by touching this piece of metal with one hand and touching the wire connected to the electrical machine with the other.
* 1745 &mdash; [[Ewald Georg von Kleist]] of independently invents the capacitor: a glass jar coated inside and out with metal. The inner coating was connected to a rod that passed through the lid and ended in a metal sphere. By having this thin layer of glass insulation (a [[dielectric]]) between two large, closely spaced plates, von Kleist found the energy density could be increased dramatically compared with the situation with no insulator. [[Daniel Gralath]] improved the design and was also the first to combine several jars to form a battery strong enough to kill birds and small animals upon discharge.
* 1746 &mdash; [[Leonhard Euler]] develops the wave theory of light refraction and dispersion
* 1747 &mdash; [[William Watson (scientist)|William Watson]], while experimenting with a Leyden jar, observes that a discharge of static electricity causes [[electric current]] to flow and develops the concept of an electrical potential ([[voltage]]).
* 1752 &mdash; [[Benjamin Franklin]] establishes the link between lightning and electricity by the flying a kite into a thunderstorm and transferring some of the charge into a Leyden jar and showed that its properties were the same as charge produced by an electrical machine. He is credited with utilizing the concepts of positive and negative charge in the explanation of then known electrical phenomenon. He theorized that there was an electrical fluid (which he proposed could be the [[Luminiferous ether#The history of light and aether|luminiferous ether]], which was used by others before and after him, to explain the [[wave theory of light]]) that was part of all material and all intervening space. The charge of any object would be neutral if the concentration of this fluid were the same both inside and outside of the body, positive if the object contained an excess of this fluid, and negative if there were a deficit. In 1749 he had documented the similar properties of lightning and electricity, such as that both an [[electric spark]] and a lightning flash produced light and sound, could kill animals, cause fires, melt metal, destroy or reverse the polarity of magnetism, and flowed through conductors and could be concentrated at sharp points. He was later able to apply the property of concentrating at sharp points by his invention of the lightning rod, for which he intentionally did not profit. He also investigated the Leyden jar, proving that the charge was stored on the glass and not in the water, as others had assumed.
* 1753 &mdash; C. M. (of Scotland, possibly Charles Morrison, of Greenock or Charles Marshall, of Aberdeen)  proposes in the 17 February edition of Scots Magazine, an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet and each connected to electrostatic machines. The receiving charged end was to electrostatically attract a disc of paper marked with the corresponding letter.
* 1767 &mdash; [[Joseph Priestley]] proposes an electrical inverse-square law
* 1774 &mdash; [[Georges-Louis LeSage]] builds an electrostatic telegraph system with 26 insulated wires conducting Leyden-jar charges to pith-ball electroscopes, each corresponding to a letter of the alphabet. Its range was only between rooms of his home.
* 1784 &mdash; [[Henry Cavendish]] defines the [[electromagnetic induction|inductive capacity]] of [[dielectrics]] (insulators) and measures the specific inductive capacity of various substances by comparison with an air condenser.
* 1785 &mdash; [[Charles-Augustin de Coulomb|Charles Coulomb]] introduces the [[Coulomb's law|inverse-square law of electrostatics]]
* 1786 &mdash; [[Luigi Galvani]] discovers "animal electricity" and postulates that animal bodies are storehouses of electricity. His invention of the voltaic cell leads to the invention the electric battery.
* 1791 &mdash; [[Luigi Galvani]] discovers galvanic electricity and [[bioelectricity]] through experiments following an observation that touching exposed muscles in frogs' legs with a scalpel which had been close to a static electrical machine caused them to jump. He called this "animal electricity". Years of experimentation in the 1780s eventually led him to the construction of an arc of two different metals (copper and zinc for example) by connecting the two metal pieces and then connecting their open ends across the nerve of a frog leg, producing the same muscular contractions (by completing a circuit) as originally accidentally observed. The use of different metals to produce an electrical spark is the basis that led Alessandro Volta in 1799 to his invention of his voltaic pile, which eventually became the [[Battery (electricity)|galvanic battery]].<ref>{{cite book|first=Henry Smith |last=Williams |title=A history of science |volume=3|url=http://www.worldwideschool.org/library/books/sci/history/AHistoryofScienceVolumeIII/chap46.html |chapter=VII.

* 1799 &mdash; [[Alessandro Volta]], following Galvani's discovery of galvanic electricity, creates a [[voltaic pile|voltaic cell]] producing an electric current by the chemical action of several pairs of alternating copper (or silver) and zinc discs "piled" and separated by cloth or cardboard which had been soaked brine (salt water) or acid to increase conductivity. In '''1800''' he demonstrates the production of light from a glowing wire conducting electricity. This was followed in 1801 by his construction of the first [[electric battery]], by utilizing multiple voltaic cells. Prior to his major discoveries, in a letter of praise to the Royal Society 1793, Volta reported Luigi Galvani's experiments of the 1780s as the "most beautiful and important discoveries", regarding them as the foundation of future discoveries. Volta's inventions led to revolutionary changes with this method of the production of inexpensive, controlled electric current vs. existing frictional machines and Leyden jars. The electric battery became standard equipment in every experimental laboratory and heralded an age of practical applications of electricity.<ref name=Clark/>{{Page needed|date=October 2015}} The unit [[volt]] is named for his contributions.

* 1800 &mdash; [[William Nicholson (chemist)|William Nicholson]], [[Anthony Carlisle]] and [[Johann Ritter]] use electricity to decompose water into hydrogen and oxygen, thereby discovering the process of [[electrolysis]], which led to the discovery of many other elements.

* 1802 &mdash; [[Gian Domenico Romagnosi]], Italian legal scholar, discovers that electricity and magnetism are related by noting that a nearby voltaic pile deflects a magnetic needle. He published his account in an Italian newspaper, but this was overlooked by the scientific community.<ref>{{cite book|last=Martins|first=Roberto de Andrade|chapter=Romagnosi and Volta's pile: early difficulties in the interpretation of Voltaic electricity|editor-last1=Bevilacqua|editor-first1=Fabio|editor-last2=Fregonese|editor-first2=Lucio|title=Nuova Voltiana: Studies on Volta and his Times|location=Pavia |publisher=Ulrico Hoepli |volume=3 |pages=81–102}}</ref>

* 1820 &mdash; [[Hans Christian Ørsted]], Danish physicist and chemist, develops an experiment in which he notices a compass needle is deflected from [[Magnetic declination|magnetic north]] when an electric current from the battery he was using was switched on and off, convincing him that magnetic fields radiate from all sides of a live wire just as light and heat do, confirming a direct relationship between electricity and magnetism. He also observes that the movement of the compass-needle to one side or the other depends upon the direction of the current.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Whittaker|first=Edmund Taylor|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_History_of_the_Theories_of_Aether_and_Electricity/Chapter_3#84|title=A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity|year=1910|pages=84–85}}</ref> Following intensive investigations, he published his findings, proving that a changing electric current produces a magnetic field as it flows through a wire. The [[oersted]] unit of magnetic induction is named for his contributions.
* 1820 &mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]], professor of mathematics at the École Polytechnique, demonstrates that parallel current-carrying wires experience magnetic force in a meeting of the [[French Academy of Science]], exactly one week after Ørsted's announcement of his discovery that a magnetic needle is acted on by a voltaic current.<ref>{{Cite book|last=Whittaker|first=Edmund Taylor|url=https://en.wikisource.org/wiki/A_History_of_the_Theories_of_Aether_and_Electricity/Chapter_3#87|title=A History of the Theories of Aether and Electricity|year=1910|page=87}}</ref> He shows that a coil of wire carrying a current behaves like an ordinary magnet and suggests that electromagnetism might be used in telegraphy. He mathematically develops [[Ampère's force law|Ampère's law]] describing the magnetic force between two electric currents. His mathematical theory explains known electromagnetic phenomena and predicts new ones. His laws of electrodynamics include the facts that parallel conductors currying current in the same direction attract and those carrying currents in the opposite directions repel one another. One of the first to develop electrical measuring techniques, he built an instrument utilizing a free-moving needle to measure the flow of electricity, contributing to the development of the [[galvanometer]]. In '''1821''', he proposed a telegraphy system utilizing one wire per "galvanometer" to indicate each letter, and reported experimenting successfully with such a system. However, in '''1824''', [[Peter Barlow (mathematician)|Peter Barlow]] reported its maximum distance was only 200 feet, and so was impractical.{{citation needed|date=October 2015}} In '''1826''' he publishes the ''Memoir on the Mathematical Theory of Electrodynamic Phenomena, Uniquely Deduced from Experience'' containing a mathematical derivation of the electrodynamic force law. Following Faraday's discovery of  electromagnetic induction in 1831, Ampère agreed that Faraday deserved full credit for the discovery.
* 1820 &mdash; [[Johann Salomo Christoph Schweigger]], German chemist, physicist, and professor, builds the first sensitive galvanometer, wrapping a coil of wire around a graduated compass, an acceptable instrument for actual measurement as well as detection of small amounts of electric current, naming it after Luigi Galvani.
* 1821 &mdash; [[André-Marie Ampère]] announces his theory of electrodynamics, predicting the force that one current exerts upon another.
* 1821 &mdash; [[Thomas Johann Seebeck]] discovers the [[thermoelectric effect]].
* 1821 &mdash; [[Augustin-Jean Fresnel]] derives a mathematical demonstration that polarization can be explained only if light is ''entirely'' transverse, with no longitudinal vibration whatsoever.
* 1825 &mdash; [[Augustin Fresnel]] phenomenologically explains optical activity by introducing circular birefringence
* 1825 &mdash; [[William Sturgeon]], founder of the first English Electric Journal, ''Annals of Electricity'', found that an iron core inside a helical coil of wire connected to a battery greatly increased the resulting magnetic field, thus making possible the more powerful [[electromagnet]]s utilizing a [[Ferromagnetism|ferromagnetic]] core. Sturgeon also bent the iron core into a U-shape to bring the poles closer together, thus concentrating the magnetic field lines. These discoveries followed Ampère's discovery that electricity passing through a coiled wire produced a magnetic force and that of [[François Arago|Dominique François Jean Arago]] finding that an iron bar is magnetized by putting it inside the coil of current-carrying wire, but Arago had not observed the increased strength of the resulting field while the bar was being magnetized.
* 1826 &mdash; [[Georg Simon Ohm]] states his [[Ohm's law]] of [[electrical resistance]] in the journals of Schweigger and Poggendorff, and also published in his landmark pamphlet ''Die galvanische Kette mathematisch bearbeitet'' in '''1827'''. The unit [[ohm (unit)|ohm]] (Ω) of electrical resistance has been named in his honor.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.juliantrubin.com/bigten/ohmlawexperiments.html |title=Georg Simon Ohm: The Discovery of Ohm's Law |publisher=Juliantrubin.com |accessdate=2011-11-15}}</ref>
* 1829 & 1830 &mdash; [[Francesco Zantedeschi]] publishes papers on the production of electric currents in closed circuits by the approach and withdrawal of a magnet, thereby anticipating Michael Faraday's classical experiments of 1831.
* 1831 &mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] began experiments leading to his discovery of the law of [[electromagnetic induction]], though the discovery may have been anticipated by the work of Francesco Zantedeschi. His breakthrough came when he wrapped two insulated coils of wire around a massive iron ring, bolted to a chair, and found that upon passing a current through one coil, a momentary electric current was induced in the other coil. He then found that if he moved a magnet through a loop of wire, or vice versa, an electric current also flowed in the wire. He then used this principle to construct the [[Dynamo|electric dynamo]], the first electric power generator. He proposed that electromagnetic forces extended into the empty space around the conductor, but did not complete that work. Faraday's concept of lines of flux emanating from charged bodies and magnets provided a way to visualize electric and magnetic fields. That mental model was crucial to the successful development of electromechanical devices which were to dominate the 19th century. His demonstrations that a changing magnetic field produces an electric field,  mathematically modeled by [[Faraday's law of induction]], would subsequently become one of [[Maxwell's equations]]. These consequently evolved into the generalization of [[Field (physics)|field theory]].
* 1831 &mdash; [[Macedonio Melloni]] uses a [[thermopile]] to detect infrared radiation
* 1832 &mdash; [[Pavel Schilling|Baron Pavel L'vovitch Schilling]] (Paul Schilling) creates the first electromagnetic telegraph, consisting of a single-needle system in which a code was used to indicate the characters. Only months later, Göttingen professors [[Carl Friedrich Gauss]] and [[Wilhelm Eduard Weber|Wilhelm Weber]] constructed a telegraph that was working two years before Schilling could put his into practice. Schilling demonstrated the long-distance transmission of signals between two different rooms of his apartment and was the first to put into practice a binary system of signal transmission.
* 1833 &mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] states [[Lenz's law]]: if an increasing (or decreasing) magnetic flux induces an [[Electromotive force|electromotive force (EMF)]], the resulting current will oppose a further increase (or decrease) in magnetic flux, i.e., that an induced current in a closed conducting loop will appear in such a direction that it opposes the change that produced it. Lenz's law is one consequence of the principle of [[conservation of energy]]. If a magnet moves towards a closed loop, then the induced current in the loop creates a field that exerts a force opposing the motion of the magnet. Lenz's law can be derived from [[Faraday's law of induction]] by noting the negative sign on the right side of the equation. He also independently discovered [[Joule's first law|Joule's law]] in '''1842'''; to honor his efforts, Russian physicists refer to it as the "Joule-Lenz law."
* 1833 &mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] announces his law of [[electrochemical equivalent]]s
* 1834 &mdash; [[Heinrich Lenz]] determines the direction of the induced [[electromotive force]] (emf) and [[Electric current|current]] resulting from [[electromagnetic induction]]. [[Lenz's law]] provides a physical interpretation of the choice of sign in [[Faraday's law of induction]] (1831), indicating that the induced emf and the change in flux have opposite signs.
* 1834 &mdash; [[Jean-Charles Peltier]] discovers the [[Peltier effect]]: heating by an electric current at the junction of two different metals.
* 1835 &mdash; [[Joseph Henry]] invents the [[relay|electric relay]], which is an electrical switch by which the change of a weak current through the windings of an electromagnet will attract an armature to open or close the switch. Because this can control (by opening or closing) another, much higher-power, circuit, it is in a broad sense a form of electrical amplifier. This made a practical electric telegraph possible. He was the first to coil insulated wire tightly around an iron core in order to make an extremely powerful electromagnet, improving on William Sturgeon's design, which used loosely coiled, uninsulated wire. He also discovered the property of [[self inductance]] independently of Michael Faraday.

* 1836 &mdash; [[William Fothergill Cooke]] invents a mechanical telegraph. '''1837''' with [[Charles Wheatstone]] invents the [[Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph|Cooke and Wheatstone needle telegraph]].  '''1838''' the Cooke and Wheatstone telegraph becomes the first commercial telegraph in the world when it is installed on the [[Great Western Railway]].
* 1837 &mdash; [[Samuel Morse]] develops an alternative electrical telegraph design capable of transmitting long distances over poor quality wire. He and his assistant [[Alfred Vail]] develop the [[Morse code]] signaling alphabet. In '''1838''' Morse successfully tested the device at the Speedwell Ironworks near [[Morristown, New Jersey]], and publicly demonstrated it to a scientific committee at the [[Franklin Institute]] in [[Philadelphia]], Pennsylvania. The first electric telegram using this device was sent by Morse on 24 May, '''1844''' from Baltimore to Washington, D.C., bearing the message "[[Book of Numbers|What hath God wrought]]?"

* 1840 &mdash; [[James Prescott Joule]] formulates [[Joule's first law|Joule's Law]] (sometimes called the Joule-Lenz law) quantifying the amount of heat produced in a circuit as proportional to the product of the time duration, the resistance, and the square of the current passing through it.
* 1845 &mdash; [[Michael Faraday]] discovers that light propagation in a material can be influenced by external [[magnetic field]]s ([[Faraday effect]])
* 1849 &mdash; [[Hippolyte Fizeau]] and [[Jean-Bernard Foucault]] measure the speed of light to be about 298,000&nbsp;km/s

* 1855 &mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] submits ''On Faraday's Lines of Force'' for publication containing a [https://archive.org/stream/scientificpapers01maxw#page/202/mode/2up mathematical statement] of [[Ampère's circuital law]] relating the curl of a magnetic field to the electrical current at a point.
* 1861 &mdash; the [[First Transcontinental Telegraph|first transcontinental telegraph system]] spans North America by connecting an existing network in the eastern United States to a small network in California by a link between Omaha and Carson City via Salt Lake City.

* 1864 &mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his papers on a dynamical theory of the [[electromagnetic field]]
* 1865 &mdash; [[James Clerk Maxwell]] publishes his landmark paper [[A Dynamical Theory of the Electromagnetic Field]], in which [[Maxwell's equations]] demonstrated that electric and [[magnetism|magnetic]] forces are two complementary aspects of [[electromagnetism]]. He shows that the associated complementary electric and magnetic fields of electromagnetism travel through space, in the form of waves, at a constant velocity of 3.0 × 10<sup>8</sup> m/s. He also proposes that light is a form of electromagnetic radiation and that waves of oscillating electric and magnetic fields travel through empty space at a speed that could be predicted from simple electrical experiments. Using available data, he obtains a velocity of 310,740,000&nbsp;m/s and states "This velocity is so nearly that of light, that it seems we have strong reason to conclude that light itself (including radiant heat, and other [[radiation]]s if any) is an electromagnetic disturbance in the form of waves propagated through the electromagnetic field according to electromagnetic laws."

This was not the first electric light bulb but the first commercially practical incandescent light. In '''1879''' he produces a high-resistance lamp in a very high vacuum; the lamp lasts hundreds of hours. While the earlier inventors had produced electric lighting in lab conditions, Edison concentrated on commercial application and was able to sell the concept to homes and businesses by mass-producing relatively long-lasting light bulbs and creating a complete system for the generation and distribution of electricity.
* 1879 &mdash; [[Joseph Stefan|Jožef Stefan]] discovers the [[Stefan–Boltzmann law|Stefan–Boltzmann radiation law]] of a [[black body]] and uses it to calculate the first sensible value of the temperature of the Sun's surface to be 5700 [[Kelvin|K]]

* 1900 &mdash; [[Max Planck]] resolves the [[ultraviolet catastrophe]] by suggesting that [[black-body radiation]] consists of discrete packets, or [[quantum|quanta]], of energy.  The amount of energy in each packet is proportional to the frequency of the electromagnetic waves.  The constant of proportionality is now called [[Planck's constant]] in his honor.

* 1905 &mdash; [[Albert Einstein]] proposes the [[Special Relativity|Theory of Special Relativity]], in which he rejects the existence of the [[Luminiferous aether|aether]] as unnecessary for explaining the propagation of electromagnetic waves. Instead, Einstein asserts ''as a [[postulate]]'' that the speed of light is constant in all [[inertial|inertial frames of reference]], and goes on to demonstrate a number of revolutionary (and highly counter-intuitive) consequences, including [[time dilation]], [[length contraction]], the [[relativity of simultaneity]], the [[relativistic mass|dependence of mass on velocity]], and the [[mass-energy equivalence|equivalence of mass and energy]].
* 1905 &mdash; Einstein explains the [[photoelectric effect]] by extending Planck's idea of light quanta, or [[photons]], to the absorption and emission of [[photoelectrons]].  Einstein would later receive the [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] for this discovery, which launched the [[quantum mechanics|quantum revolution]] in physics.
* 1911 &mdash; [[Superconductivity]] is discovered by [[Heike Kamerlingh Onnes]], who was studying the resistivity of solid mercury at cryogenic temperatures using the recently discovered liquid helium as a refrigerant.
