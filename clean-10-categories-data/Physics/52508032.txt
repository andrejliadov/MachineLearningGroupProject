The '''Batchelor Prize''' is an award presented once every four years by the [[International Union of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics]] (IUTAM) for outstanding research in [[fluid dynamics]]. The prize of $25,000 is sponsored by the [[Journal of Fluid Mechanics]] and presented at the International Congress of Theoretical and Applied Mechanics (ICTAM).  The research recognised by the Prize will normally have been published during the ten-year period prior to the award to ensure that the work is of current interest.<ref> {{cite web|url=http://iutam.org/the-batchelor-prize-in-fluid-mechanics/|title=The Batchelor Prize in Fluid Mechanics|publisher= IUTAM|accessdate= 7 December 2016}}</ref>

The award is named in honour of [[George Batchelor]], an [[Australians|Australian]] applied [[mathematician]] and fluid dynamicist.
