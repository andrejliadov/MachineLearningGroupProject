{{short description|Idea of creating a place or object that is free from the force of gravity}}
{{Use dmy dates|date=May 2015}}
'''Anti-gravity''' (also known as ''non-gravitational field'') is a hypothetical phenomenon of creating a place or object that is free from the force of [[gravity]]. It does not refer to the lack of weight under gravity experienced in [[free fall]] or [[orbit]], or to balancing the force of gravity with some other force, such as electromagnetism or aerodynamic lift. Anti-gravity is a recurring concept in science fiction, particularly in the context of [[spacecraft propulsion]].  Examples are the gravity blocking substance "Cavorite" in [[H. G. Wells]]'s ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]'' and the [[Spindizzy]] machines in [[James Blish|James Blish's]] ''[[Cities in Flight]]''.

"Anti-gravity" is often used to refer to devices that look as if they reverse gravity even though they operate through other means, such as [[Ionocraft|lifters]], which fly in the air by moving air with [[electromagnetic field]]s.<ref>{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.08/pwr_antigravity.html|accessdate=23 July 2010|first=Clive|last=Thompson|work=[[Wired Magazine|Wired]]|date=August 2003|title=The Antigravity Underground| archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100818230902/http://www.wired.com/wired/archive/11.08/pwr_antigravity.html| archive-date= 18 August 2010 | url-status= live}}</ref><ref>{{cite web|url=http://paranormal.about.com/library/weekly/aa081902a.htm|title=On the Verge of Antigravity|publisher=[[About.com]]|accessdate=23 July 2010}}</ref>

What's commonly misconstrued is that while anti-gravity is the nullification of gravity, it is not repulsive gravity or negative gravity. Gravity plates and compensators as envisioned in contemporary science fiction also are not anti-gravity.

==Historical attempts at understanding gravity==

The possibility of creating anti-gravity depends upon the detection and description of gravity at the quantum dimension; as of 2020 physicists have yet to discover the [[quantum gravity|quantum nature of gravity]].<ref name="Riesselmann"/>

==Hypothetical solutions==
In [[Newton's law of universal gravitation]], gravity was an external force transmitted by unknown means. In the 20th century, Newton's model was replaced by [[general relativity]] where gravity is not a force but the result of the geometry of spacetime. Under general relativity, anti-gravity is impossible except under contrived circumstances.<ref>Peskin, M and Schroeder, D.; ''An Introduction to Quantum Field Theory'' (Westview Press, 1995) {{ISBN|0-201-50397-2}}</ref><ref>{{cite book | author = Wald, Robert M.| author-link = Robert M.

In 1948 businessman [[Roger Babson]] (founder of [[Babson College]]) formed the [[Gravity Research Foundation]] to study ways to reduce the effects of gravity.<ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Mooallem | first1 = J. | date = October 2007 | title = A curious attraction | journal = Harper's Magazine | volume = 315 | issue = 1889 | pages = 84–91 }}</ref> Their efforts were initially somewhat "[[crank (person)|crank]]ish", but they held occasional conferences that drew such people as [[Clarence Birdseye]], known for his frozen-food products, and [[Igor Sikorsky]], inventor of the helicopter. Over time the Foundation turned its attention away from trying to control gravity, to simply better understanding it. The Foundation nearly disappeared after Babson's death in 1967. However, it continues to run an essay award, offering prizes of up to $4,000. As of 2017, it is still administered out of [[Wellesley, Massachusetts]], by George Rideout, Jr., son of the foundation's original director.<ref>[http://www.gravityresearchfoundation.org/winners_name.html#s List of winners] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121228174605/http://www.gravityresearchfoundation.org/winners_name.html |date=28 December 2012 }}</ref> Winners include California astrophysicist [[George F. Smoot]], who later won the 2006 [[Nobel Prize in physics]].

===General relativity research in the 1950s===
{{Main|United States gravity control propulsion research}}

General relativity was introduced in the 1910s, but development of the theory was greatly slowed by a lack of suitable mathematical tools.{{clarify|reason=The mathematics of general relativity was little known at the time, but it is dubious that new tools would have to be developed to further explore the theory, once it had been formulated. A more important factor is likely that the empirical evidence for GR over Newtonian gravity for several decades consisted of only three astronomical phenomena — why worry about fine details, when you can just barely measure any effect at all?|date=July 2018}} It appeared that anti-gravity was outlawed under general relativity.

It is claimed the [[US Air Force]] also ran a study effort throughout the 1950s and into the 1960s.<ref>Goldberg, J. M. (1992). US air force support of general relativity: 1956–1972. In, J. Eisenstaedt & A. J. Kox (Ed.), ''Studies in the History of General Relativity, Volume 3'' Boston, Massachusetts: Center for Einstein Studies. {{ISBN|0-8176-3479-7}}</ref> Former Lieutenant Colonel [[Ansel Talbert]] wrote two series of newspaper articles claiming that most of the major aviation firms had started gravity control propulsion research in the 1950s. However, there is little outside confirmation of these stories, and since they take place in the midst of the [[policy by press release]] era, it is not clear how much weight these stories should be given.

It is known that there were serious efforts underway at the [[Glenn L. Martin Company]], who formed the Research Institute for Advanced Study.<ref>Mallan, L. (1958). ''Space satellites'' (How to book 364). Greenwich, CT: Fawcett Publications, pp. 9–10, 137, 139. LCCN 58-001060</ref><ref>{{cite journal | last1 = Clarke | first1 = A. C. | date = 1957 | title = The conquest of gravity | journal = Holiday | volume = 22 | issue = 6| page = 62 }}</ref> Major newspapers announced the contract that had been made between theoretical physicist [[Burkhard Heim]] and the Glenn L. Martin Company. Another effort in the private sector to master understanding of gravitation was the creation of the Institute for Field Physics, [[University of North Carolina at Chapel Hill]] in 1956, by Gravity Research Foundation trustee [[Agnew H. Bahnson]].

Military support for anti-gravity projects was terminated by the [[Mansfield Amendment]] of 1973, which restricted [[United States Department of Defense|Department of Defense]] spending to only the areas of scientific research with explicit military applications. The Mansfield Amendment was passed specifically to end long-running projects that had little to show for their efforts.

Under general relativity, gravity is the result of following spatial geometry (change in the normal shape of space) caused by local mass-energy. This theory holds that it is the altered shape of space, deformed by massive objects, that causes gravity, which is actually a property of deformed space rather than being a true force. Although the equations cannot normally produce a "negative geometry", it is possible to do so by using "[[negative mass]]". The same equations do not, of themselves, rule out the existence of negative mass.

Both general relativity and Newtonian gravity appear to predict that negative mass would produce a repulsive gravitational field. In particular, Sir [[Hermann Bondi]] proposed in 1957 that negative gravitational mass, combined with negative inertial mass, would comply with the [[strong equivalence principle]] of general relativity theory and the Newtonian laws of conservation of linear momentum and energy. Bondi's proof yielded singularity-free solutions for the relativity equations.<ref name="Bondi">{{cite journal | last1 = Bondi | first1 = H. | date = 1957 | title = Negative mass in general relativity | journal = Reviews of Modern Physics | volume = 29 | issue = 3| pages = 423–428 | doi=10.1103/revmodphys.29.423|bibcode = 1957RvMP...29..423B }}</ref> In July 1988, [[Robert L. Forward]] presented a paper at the AIAA/ASME/SAE/ASEE 24th Joint Propulsion Conference that proposed a Bondi negative gravitational mass propulsion system.<ref name= "Forward">{{cite journal | last1 = Forward | first1 = R. L. | year = 1990 | title =  Negative matter propulsion | journal = Journal of Propulsion and Power | volume = 6 | issue = 1| pages = 28–37 | doi=10.2514/3.23219}}; see also commentary {{cite journal | last1 = Landis | first1 = G.A. | year = 1991 | title = Comments on Negative Mass Propulsion | journal = Journal of Propulsion and Power | volume = 7 | issue = 2| page = 304 | doi=10.2514/3.23327}}</ref>

Bondi pointed out that a negative mass will fall toward (and not away from) "normal" matter, since although the gravitational force is repulsive, the negative mass (according to Newton's law, F=ma) responds by accelerating in the opposite of the direction of the force. Normal mass, on the other hand, will fall away from the negative matter. He noted that two identical masses, one positive and one negative, placed near each other will therefore self-accelerate in the direction of the line between them, with the negative mass chasing after the positive mass.<ref name="Bondi" /> Notice that because the negative mass acquires negative [[kinetic energy]], the total energy of the accelerating masses remains at zero. Forward pointed out that the self-acceleration effect is due to the negative inertial mass, and could be seen induced without the gravitational forces between the particles.<ref name="Forward" />

The [[Standard Model]] of particle physics, which describes all currently known forms of matter, does not include negative mass. Although cosmological [[dark matter]] may consist of particles outside the Standard Model whose nature is unknown, their mass is ostensibly known – since they were postulated from their gravitational effects on surrounding objects, which implies their mass is positive. The proposed cosmological [[dark energy]], on the other hand, is more complicated, since according to general relativity the effects of both its energy density and its negative pressure contribute to its gravitational effect.

===Fifth force===
Under general relativity any form of energy couples with spacetime to create the geometries that cause gravity. A longstanding question was whether or not these same equations applied to [[antimatter]]. The issue was considered solved in 1960 with the development of [[CPT symmetry]], which demonstrated that antimatter follows the same laws of physics as "normal" matter, and therefore has positive energy content and also causes (and reacts to) gravity like normal matter (see [[gravitational interaction of antimatter]]).

For much of the last quarter of the 20th century, the physics community was involved in attempts to produce a [[unified field theory]], a single physical theory that explains the four fundamental forces: gravity, electromagnetism, and the strong and weak nuclear forces. Scientists have made progress in [[grand unification theory|unifying the three quantum forces]], but gravity has remained "the problem" in every attempt. This has not stopped any number of such attempts from being made, however.

Generally these attempts tried to "quantize gravity" by positing a particle, the [[graviton]], that carried gravity in the same way that [[photon]]s (light) carry electromagnetism. Simple attempts along this direction all failed, however, leading to more complex examples that attempted to account for these problems. Two of these, [[supersymmetry]] and the relativity related [[supergravity]], both required the existence of an extremely weak "fifth force" carried by a [[graviphoton]], which coupled together several "loose ends" in quantum field theory, in an organized manner. As a side effect, both theories also all but required that antimatter be affected by this fifth force in a way similar to anti-gravity, dictating repulsion away from mass. Several experiments were carried out in the 1990s to measure this effect, but none yielded positive results.<ref name=SciAm79>''Supergravity and the Unification of the Laws of Physics,'' by Daniel Z. Freedman and Peter van Nieuwenhuizen, Scientific American, February 1978</ref>

In 2013 [[CERN]] looked for an antigravity effect in an experiment designed to study the energy levels within antihydrogen. The antigravity measurement was just an "interesting sideshow" and was inconclusive.<ref>[https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-22355187 Jason Palmer, Antigravity gets first test at Cern's Alpha experiment, bbc.co.uk, 30 April 2013 ]</ref>

===General-relativistic "warp drives"===
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2015}}
There are solutions of the field equations of general relativity which describe "warp drives" (such as the [[Alcubierre metric]]) and stable, traversable [[wormholes]]. This by itself is not significant, since ''any'' spacetime geometry is a solution of the field equations for some configuration of the [[stress–energy tensor]] field (see [[exact solutions in general relativity]]). General relativity does not constrain the geometry of spacetime unless outside constraints are placed on the stress–energy tensor. Warp-drive and traversable-wormhole geometries are well-behaved in most areas, but require regions of [[exotic matter]]; thus they are excluded as solutions if the stress–energy tensor is limited to known forms of matter. Dark matter and dark energy are not understood enough at this present time to make general statements regarding their applicability to a warp-drive.

===Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program===
During the close of the twentieth century [[NASA]] provided funding for the [[Breakthrough Propulsion Physics Program]] (BPP) from 1996 through 2002. This program studied a number of "far out" designs for space propulsion that were not receiving funding through normal university or commercial channels. Anti-gravity-like concepts were investigated under the name "diametric drive". The work of the BPP program continues in the independent, non-NASA affiliated [[Tau Zero Foundation]].<ref>[http://www.tauzero.aero/ Tau Zero Foundation]</ref>

==Empirical claims and commercial efforts==
There have been a number of attempts to build anti-gravity devices, and a small number of reports of anti-gravity-like effects in the scientific literature. None of the examples that follow are accepted as reproducible examples of anti-gravity.

===Gyroscopic devices===
[[File:H W Wallace force field figure 4.png|thumb|350px|A "kinemassic field" generator from {{US patent|3626605}}: Method and apparatus for generating a secondary gravitational force field]]
[[Gyroscope]]s produce a force when twisted that operates "out of plane" and can appear to lift themselves against gravity. Although this force is well understood to be illusory, even under Newtonian models, it has nevertheless generated numerous claims of anti-gravity devices and any number of patented devices. None of these devices have ever been demonstrated to work under controlled conditions, and have often become the subject of [[conspiracy theories]] as a result.

Another "rotating device" example is shown in a series of patents granted to Henry Wallace between 1968 and 1974. His devices consist of rapidly spinning disks of [[brass]], a material made up largely of elements with a total half-integer nuclear spin. He claimed that by rapidly rotating a disk of such material, the [[nuclear spin]] became aligned, and as a result created a "gravitomagnetic" field in a fashion similar to the magnetic field created by the [[Barnett effect]].<ref>{{US patent|3626606}}</ref><ref>{{US patent|3626605}}</ref><ref>{{US patent|3823570}}</ref> No independent testing or public demonstration of these devices is known.

In 1989, it was reported that a weight decreases along the axis of a right spinning gyroscope.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Hayasaka, H.|author2=Takeuchi, S.|name-list-style=amp|date=1989|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|title=Anomalous weight reduction on a gyroscope's right rotations around the vertical axis on the Earth|volume=63|issue=25|pages=2701–2704|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.63.2701|pmid=10040968|bibcode=1989PhRvL..63.2701H}}</ref> A test of this claim a year later yielded null results.<ref>{{cite journal|author=Nitschke, J.

===Thomas Townsend Brown's gravitator===
{{Further|Biefeld-Brown effect|Electrogravitics|United States gravity control propulsion research#Brown's gravitator}}
In 1921, while still in [[high school]], [[Thomas Townsend Brown]] found that a high-voltage [[Coolidge tube]] seemed to change mass depending on its orientation on a balance scale. Through the 1920s Brown developed this into devices that combined high voltages with materials with high [[dielectric]] constants (essentially large [[capacitors]]); he called such a device a "gravitator". Brown made the claim to observers and in the media that his experiments were showing anti-gravity effects. Brown would continue his work and produced a series of high-voltage devices in the following years in attempts to sell his ideas to aircraft companies and the military. He coined the names [[Biefeld–Brown effect]] and [[electrogravitics]] in conjunction with his devices. Brown tested his asymmetrical capacitor devices in a vacuum, supposedly showing it was not a more down-to-earth [[electrohydrodynamic]] effect generated by high voltage ion flow in air.

Electrogravitics is a popular topic in [[ufology]], anti-gravity, [[Free energy suppression|free energy]], with government conspiracy theorists and related websites, in books and publications with claims that the technology became highly classified in the early 1960s and that it is used to power UFOs and the B-2 bomber.<ref name="Wired">{{Cite news

===Gravitoelectric coupling===
In 1992, the Russian researcher [[Eugene Podkletnov]] claimed to have discovered, whilst experimenting with [[superconductor]]s, that a fast rotating superconductor reduces the gravitational effect.<ref>{{cite journal|last1=Podkletnov|first1=E|last2=Nieminen|first2=R |title=A possibility of gravitational force shielding by bulk YBa2Cu3O7−x superconductor|journal=[[Physica C]] |volume=203|issue=3–4|date=10 December 1992|pages=441–444|bibcode = 1992PhyC..203..441P |doi = 10.1016/0921-4534(92)90055-H }}</ref> Many studies have attempted to reproduce Podkletnov's experiment, always to negative results.<ref>{{cite journal| display-authors=4| author=N.

[[Ning Li (physicist)|Ning Li]] and [[Douglas Torr]], of the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] proposed how a time dependent magnetic field could cause the spins of the lattice ions in a superconductor to generate detectable [[gravitomagnetic]] and gravitoelectric fields in a series of papers published between 1991 and 1993.<ref>{{cite journal|journal=Physical Review|date=1 September 1992|doi=10.1103/PhysRevB.46.5489|pmid=10004334|title=Gravitational effects on the magnetic attenuation of superconductors|last1=Li|first1=Ning|last2=Torr|first2=DG|volume=B46|issue=9|pages=5489–5495|bibcode = 1992PhRvB..46.5489L }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|journal=Physical Review|date=15 January 1991|title=Effects of a gravitomagnetic field on pure superconductors|last1=Li|first1=Ning|last2=Torr|first2=DG|volume=D43|issue=2|pages=457–459|doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.43.457|pmid=10013404|bibcode = 1991PhRvD..43..457L }}</ref><ref>{{cite journal|last1=Li|first1=Ning|last2=Torr|first2=DG|journal=Foundations of Physics Letters|title=Gravitoelectric-electric coupling via superconductivity|volume=6|issue=4|pages=371–383|date=August 1993|bibcode = 1993FoPhL...6..371T |doi = 10.1007/BF00665654 |s2cid=122075917}}</ref> In 1999, Li and her team appeared in ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'', claiming to have constructed a working [[prototype]] to generate what she described as "AC Gravity."

Douglas Torr and [[Timir Datta]] were involved in the development of a "gravity generator" at the [[University of South Carolina]].<ref>{{cite web|title=Patent and Copyright Committee List of Disclosures Reviewed Between July 1996 and June 1997 - USC ID|number=96140|url=http://www.sc.edu/faculty/senate/97/annual/patentlist.html|accessdate=2 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140502013440/http://www.sc.edu/faculty/senate/97/annual/patentlist.html|archive-date=2 May 2014}}</ref> According to a leaked document from the Office of Technology Transfer at the University of South Carolina and confirmed to [[Wired (magazine)|''Wired'']] reporter Charles Platt in 1998, the device would create a "force beam" in any desired direction and that the university planned to patent and license this device.

==Göde Award==
The Institute for Gravity Research of the Göde Scientific Foundation has tried to reproduce many of the different experiments which claim any "anti-gravity" effects. All attempts by this group to observe an anti-gravity effect by reproducing past experiments have been unsuccessful thus far. The foundation has offered a reward of one million euros for a reproducible anti-gravity experiment.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.goede-stiftung.org/uk/institute-for-gravity-research/goede-award.html|title=The Göde award - One Million Euro to overcome gravity|publisher=Institute of Gravity Research|accessdate=2 January 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150428051435/http://www.goede-stiftung.org/uk/institute-for-gravity-research/goede-award.html|archive-date=28 April 2015|url-status=dead}}</ref>

==In fiction==
The existence of a anti-gravity is a common theme in [[fantasy]] and [[science fiction]].

===Apergy===
'''Apergy''' is a fictitious form of anti-gravitational energy first described by [[Percy Greg]] in his 1880 [[sword and planet]] novel ''[[Across the Zodiac]]''.<ref name="Nicholls1979">{{cite book|author=Peter Nicholls|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NzAqAQAAIAAJ|title=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction: An Illustrated A to Z|publisher=Unknown Publisher|year=1979|isbn=978-0-246-11020-6}}</ref>

It is also used by [[John Jacob Astor IV]] in his 1894 science fiction novel, ''[[A Journey in Other Worlds]]''.<ref>{{cite book |last1=Astor |first1=John Jacob |title=A journey in other worlds. A romance of the future |date=1894 |publisher=D. Appleton and Company |url=https://archive.org/details/ajourneyinother02astogoog/page/n44/mode/2up/search/apergy |accessdate=11 March 2020}}</ref>

Apergy can also be found in an 1896 article by [[Clara Jessup Moore|Clara Jessup Bloomfield-Moore]], called "Some Truths About Keely".<ref name="Stoddart1895">{{cite book|author=J. M. Stoddart|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=t7POAAAAMAAJ&pg=PA321|title=The New Science Review: A Miscellany of Modern Thought and Discovery|publisher=Transatlantic Publishing Company|year=1895|pages=321–}}</ref> In it, apergy is used to describe the [[:wikt:latent|latent]] force [[John Keely]] harnessed, by using frequency to release the latent force found within all atomic [[matter]].<ref name="Paijmans2004">{{cite book|author=Theo Paijmans|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=O3wZ4mbPb-AC&pg=PA221|title=Free Energy Pioneer: John Worrell Keely|publisher=Adventures Unlimited Press|year=2004|isbn=978-1-931882-33-0|pages=221–}}</ref>

In an 1897, ostensibly non-fictitious, article in [[San Francisco Call|''The San Francisco Call'']] titled "The Secret of Aerial Flight Revealed",<ref>http://chroniclingamerica.loc.gov/lccn/sn85066387/1897-01-17/ed-1/seq-20/ ''The San Francisco Call'', January 17, 1897, p.18.</ref> science correspondent [[Frank M. Close]], D. Sc., visits an unnamed Hindu man masquerading as a [[viticulturist]] somewhere on the [[West Coast of the United States|Pacific coast]] who claims to have invented a flying boat that uses an "apergent" -- a rare metal called "radlum" -- to produce controlled apergic force, allowing the vessel to ascend and descend. The inventor describes apergy as "a force obtained by blending positive and negative electricity with ultheic, the third element or state of electric energy" and calls apergy a "second phase of gravity", hinting at a third phase as well.

In [[S. P. Meek]]'s short story "Cold Light", which appeared in ''Astounding Stories of Super-Science'', March 1930,<ref>{{Cite web | url=https://www.gutenberg.org/files/29607/29607-h/29607-h.htm | title=The Project Gutenberg eBook of Astounding Stories of Super-Science, March 1930}}</ref> apergy is mentioned as the opposite force of gravity.

In [[Chris Roberson (author)|Chris Roberson]]'s short story "Annus Mirabilis" from the 2006 second volume of ''[[Tales of the Shadowmen]]'', [[Doctor Omega]] and [[Albert Einstein]] investigate apergy. Apergy is also mentioned in the [[Warren Ellis]] comic ''[[Aetheric Mechanics]]'', as being generated by [[Cavorite]] technology from ''[[The First Men in the Moon]]''.
