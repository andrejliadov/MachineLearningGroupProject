'''Andrew Pritchard''' [[FRSE]] (14 December 1804 – 24 November 1882) was an English naturalist and [[natural history]] dealer who made significant improvements to [[microscopy]] and studied microscopic organisms. His belief that God and nature were one led him to the [[Unitarianism|Unitarians]], a religious movement to which he and his family devoted much energy. He became a leading member of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]] in [[north London]], and worked to build a school there.

==Early life==
Andrew Pritchard was born in [[Hackney Central|Hackney]], then a village just north of [[London]] on 14 December 1804, the son of John Pritchard and his wife, Ann Fleetwood. He was educated at [[St Saviour's Grammar School]] in [[Southwark]].<ref>{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783–2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0-902-198-84-X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf|access-date=22 January 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304074135/https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp2.pdf|archive-date=4 March 2016|url-status=dead}}</ref>

Pritchard was apprenticed to his cousin [[Cornelius Varley]], an artist deeply interested in science. For his improvements in the ''[[camera lucida]]'', the ''[[camera obscura]]'' and the [[microscope]], Cornelius Varley received the [[Isis Gold Medal]] of the [[Society of Arts]] and later, at the [[Great Exhibition]], he gained a medal for his invention of the [[graphic telescope]].{{sfn|Chisholm|1911|pp=921,922}} Cornelius's brother was the painter [[John Varley (painter)|John Varley]], but Pritchard would have seen more of Cornelius's son [[C. F. Varley|Cromwell Fleetwood Varley]], an engineer who pioneered the [[transatlantic telegraph cable]].

==Microscopy==
Pritchard set up as an optician, and also sold [[microscopes]] and microslide preparations. These slides he prepared by studying the microscopic organisms that he saw, and identifying and labelling them. Starting in 1830, he collaborated with C.R. Goring to produce beautifully illustrated books showing the "[[animalcules]]" visible through the microscope. His shops were in [[central London]], more towards [[City of London|The City]] than the [[West End of London|West End]], variously at 162 [[Fleet Street]], Pickett Street and 312 & 263 [[Strand, London|The Strand]]. The ''[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]'' says his ''List of 2000 Microscopic Objects'' (1835) "is very important in the history of microscopy... his ''History of the Infusoria'' (1841) was long a [[reference work|standard work]], and the impetus it gave to the study of biological science cannot be overestimated." ("[[Infusoria]]" is a term then current for aquatic micro-organisms.) This latter book was enlarged and revised by [[John Ralfs]] and other botanists; Pritchard in turn condensed Ralfs's contribution on the diatomaceæ ([[diatom]]s, a type of [[phytoplankton]]), and wrote many books and articles on "natural history as seen through the microscope, on optical instruments, and on patents"<ref>ONDB article</ref>

==Religious ties==
Pritchard held various [[Dissenters|Dissenting]] religious views over his lifetime, holding that [[Relationship between religion and science|science and religion]] were one.<ref>"He considered that scientific research must result in deeper awareness of religious truth, whilst the pursuit of religious truth can only be undertaken in the open minded spirit of scientific enquiry."

Money aside, Pritchard would not have been able to attend an English university as a young man, for example, because the only two, Oxford and Cambridge, restricted entry to members of the [[Church of England]]. "No-one exists divorced from immediate and larger social environments. Dissenters led educational reform, especially in giving "lower orders" scientific knowledge and skill."<ref>[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag//artsep10/pp-cvsmith.html "CHARLES HENRY VANCE SMITH – MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE"] by Peter B. Paisley in ''Microscopy Magazine", September 2010.</ref>

Pritchard joined the congregation of [[Newington Green Unitarian Church]], an establishment long connected with scientific enquiry ([[Joseph Priestley]]), education ([[Mary Wollstonecraft]]), and political dissent ([[Richard Price]]). He is described in the church's history as "the leading member of the congregation". From 1850 to 1873 he was its treasurer, during which time donations doubled. Before the passage of the [[Elementary Education Act 1870]], [[Compulsory education|compulsory schooling]] did not exist, so the church started a school to offer education to the village children. He led the Newington Green Conversation Society, membership restricted to 16, a successor to the Mutual Instruction Society.<ref>p23-24. {{cite book | last = Thorncroft | first = Michael | title = Trust in Freedom: The Story of Newington Green Unitarian Church 1708 – 1958 | publisher = Private publication for the trustees of the church | year = 1958 | location = London | pages = 35}}</ref> Faraday was a frequent visitor.<ref>[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag//artsep10/pp-cvsmith.html "CHARLES HENRY VANCE SMITH – MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE"] by Peter B. Paisley in ''Microscopy Magazine'', September 2010.</ref>

==Death==
Pritchard died in [[Highbury]] in London on 24 November 1882.

==Family==
He married Caroline Isabella Straker in 1829 and they had several children. His wife was chair of the chapel organisation,<ref>[http://www.microscopy-uk.org.uk/mag//artsep10/pp-cvsmith.html "CHARLES HENRY VANCE SMITH – MORE THAN MEETS THE EYE"] by Peter B. Paisley in ''Microscopy Magazine", September 2010.</ref> and after a few decades there were 20 Pritchards involved in the chapel.<ref>chapter 7 {{cite book | last = Thorncroft | first = Michael | title = Trust in Freedom: The Story of Newington Green Unitarian Church 1708 – 1958 | publisher = Private publication for the trustees of the church | year = 1958 | location = London | pages = 35}}</ref> Their son Henry Baden Pritchard (1841–1884) was a chemist, traveller, and photographer. Their son Andrew Goring Pritchard, a solicitor, was a leading light of the [[Municipal borough#Municipal Corporations Act 1835|Association of Municipal Corporations]]; his son, Clive Fleetwood Pritchard, a barrister, became mayor of [[Hampstead]];<ref>[http://www.lib.uea.ac.uk/lib/libinf/find/archives/pritchard/pp1ch.htm List of library archives]</ref> ''his'' son [[Jack Pritchard]] (1899-1992) co-founded the [[Isokon]] design company, famous for the [[Lawn Road Flats]].

Andrew and Caroline's son, Ion (died 1929) and daughter Marian (died 1908), continued the work of their parents at the Newington Green Unitarian Church.<ref>See, for example, the [[Essex Hall]] [https://archive.org/stream/essexhallyearbo00assogoog/essexhallyearbo00assogoog_djvu.txt ''Yearbook'' of 1903]</ref> The cause of [[liberal religion]] in general, and the development of the [[General Assembly of Unitarian and Free Christian Churches]], were overarching themes. Ion was President of the Sunday School Association,<ref>[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924029357062/cu31924029357062_djvu.txt RELIGION AND LIBERTY. ADDRESSES AND PAPERS AT THE SECOND INTERNATIONAL COUNCIL OF UNITARIAN AND OTHER LIBERAL RELIGIOUS THINKERS AND WORKERS, HELD IN AMSTERDAM, SEPTEMBER, 1903. EDITED BY P. H. HUGENHOLTZ Jr. Leyden, 1904]</ref> one of the precursors to the General Assembly. Marian in particular is described as an unsung heroine, and "one of the leaders of modern Unitarianism". She set up Oxford Summer Schools for the training of Sunday School teachers, and Winifred House Invalid Children's Convalescent Home.<ref>Thorncroft, p28, and throughout ch7 "The Lights Go Out".</ref>
