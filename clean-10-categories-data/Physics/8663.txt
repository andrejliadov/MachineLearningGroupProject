'''Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit''' [[Fellow of the Royal Society|FRS]] ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|ær|ə|n|h|aɪ|t}}; {{IPA-de|ˈfaːʁənhaɪt|lang}}; 24 May 1686 – 16 September 1736)<ref>{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Fahrenheit, Gabriel Daniel |volume=10}}</ref> was a [[physicist]], [[inventor]], and [[scientific instrument]] maker. Fahrenheit was born in [[Danzig]] (Gdańsk), then a predominantly German-speaking city in the [[Pomeranian Voivodeship (1466–1772)|Pomeranian Voivodeship]] of the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]]. He later moved to the [[Dutch Republic]] at age 15, where he spent the rest of his life (1701–1736) and was one of the notable figures in the [[Dutch Golden Age|Golden Age of Dutch science and technology]].

A pioneer of exact thermometry,<ref>Grigull, Ulrich (1966). ''Fahrenheit, a Pioneer of Exact Thermometry''. (The Proceedings of the 8th International Heat Transfer Conference, San Francisco, 1966, Vol. 1, pp. 9–18.)</ref> he helped lay the foundations for the era of precision thermometry by inventing the [[mercury-in-glass thermometer]] (first widely used, practical, accurate [[thermometer]]) and [[Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit scale]] (first standardized [[temperature scale]] to be widely used).<ref name="britannica.com">Encyclopædia Britannica: [http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/200226/Daniel-Gabriel-Fahrenheit "Science & Technology: Daniel Gabriel Fahrenheit" ]</ref> In other words, Fahrenheit's inventions ushered in the first revolution in the history of [[thermometry]] (branch of physics concerned with methods of [[temperature measurement]]). From the early 1710s until the beginnings of the electronic era, mercury-in-glass thermometers were among the most reliable and accurate thermometers ever invented.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://aashtoresource.org/university/newsletters/newsletters/2016/08/02/the-anatomy-of-a-liquid-in-glass-thermometer |author=Knake, Maria |title=The Anatomy of a Liquid-in-Glass Thermometer |publisher=AASHTO re:source, formerly AMRL (aashtoresource.org) |quote=For decades mercury thermometers were a mainstay in many testing laboratories. If used properly and [[Calibration|calibrated]] correctly, certain types of mercury thermometers can be incredibly accurate. Mercury thermometers can be used in temperatures ranging from about -38 to 350°C. The use of a mercury-[[thallium]] mixture can extend the low-temperature usability of mercury thermometers to -56°C. (...) Nevertheless, few liquids have been found to mimic the thermometric properties of mercury in [[repeatability]] and [[accuracy]] of [[temperature measurement]]. Toxic though it may be, when it comes to LiG [Liquid-in-Glass] thermometers, mercury is still hard to beat. |date=April 2011 |accessdate=4 August 2018 }}</ref>

== Biography ==
Fahrenheit was born in Danzig (Gdańsk), then in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]], but lived most of his life in the [[Dutch Republic]]. The Fahrenheits were a German [[Hanse]] merchant family who had lived in several [[Hanseatic League|Hanseatic]] cities. Fahrenheit's great-grandfather had lived in [[Rostock]], and research suggests that the Fahrenheit family originated in [[Hildesheim]].<ref>{{cite book |author=Kant, Horst |title=G. D. Fahrenheit / R. -A. F. de Réaumur / A. Celsius |year=1984 |publisher=B. G. Teubner |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XYKtGQAACAAJ |accessdate=14 June 2008}}</ref> Daniel's grandfather moved from [[Kneiphof]] in [[Königsberg]] (present-day Kaliningrad) to Danzig and settled there as a merchant in 1650. His son, Daniel Fahrenheit (the father of Daniel Gabriel), married Concordia Schumann, daughter of a well-known Danzig business family. Daniel was the eldest of the five Fahrenheit children (two sons, three daughters) who survived childhood. His sister, Virginia Elisabeth Fahrenheit, married Benjamin Krüger and was the mother of Benjamin Ephraim Krüger, a clergyman and playwright.<ref>See the [http://www.g-gruppen.net/danzigforedt.htm#a2 Fahrenheit and Krueger genealogies].</ref>

Daniel Gabriel  began training as a merchant in [[Amsterdam]] after his parents died on 14 August 1701 from eating [[Amanita phalloides|poisonous mushrooms]]. However, Fahrenheit's interest in natural science led him to begin studies and experimentation in that field. From 1717, he traveled to [[Berlin]], [[Halle, Saxony-Anhalt|Halle]], [[Leipzig]], [[Dresden]], [[Copenhagen]], and also to his hometown, where his brother still lived. During that time, Fahrenheit met or was in contact with [[Ole Rømer]], [[Christian Wolff (philosopher)|Christian Wolff]], and [[Gottfried Leibniz]]. In 1717, Fahrenheit settled in [[The Hague]] as a [[glassblower]], making [[barometer]]s, [[altimeter]]s, and [[thermometer]]s. From 1718 onwards, he lectured in [[chemistry]] in Amsterdam.  He visited England in 1724 and was the same year elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].<ref>{{Cite web |url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=((text)%3D'fahrenheit') |title=The Royal Society Archive catalogue |access-date=26 November 2010 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111127053001/http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&dsqApp=Archive&dsqCmd=Show.tcl&dsqDb=Persons&dsqPos=0&dsqSearch=((text)%3D'fahrenheit') |archive-date=27 November 2011 |url-status=dead }}</ref> From August 1736 Fahrenheit stayed in the house of Johannes Frisleven at [[Het Plein|Plein square]] in The Hague, in connection with an application for a [[patent]] at the [[States of Holland and West Friesland]]. At the beginning of September he became ill and on the 7th his health had deteriorated to such an extent that he had [[notary]] Willem Ruijsbroek come to draw up his will. On the 11th the notary came by again to make some changes. Five days after that Fahrenheit died at the age of fifty. Four days later he received a fourth-class funeral, which meant that he was [[destitute]], in the [[Kloosterkerk, The Hague|Kloosterkerk]] in The Hague.

== Fahrenheit scale ==
{{main|Fahrenheit}}
According to Fahrenheit's 1724 article,<ref name="ftempsc"/><ref>Fahrenheit describes, in Latin, these numerical choices in the following paper: {{cite journal |author=Fahrenheit, D. G. |title=Experimenta et Observationes de Congelatione aquae in vacuo factae |journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society |volume=33 |pages=78–84 |year=1724 |doi=10.1098/rstl.1724.0016 |issue=381–391 |doi-access=free }}</ref> he determined his scale by reference to three fixed points of [[temperature]].  The lowest temperature was achieved by preparing a [[frigorific mixture]] of [[ice]], water, and a salt ("[[ammonium chloride]] or even sea salt"), and waiting for the [[eutectic system]] to reach [[equilibrium temperature]].  The thermometer then was placed into the mixture and the liquid in the thermometer allowed to descend to its lowest point.  The thermometer's reading there was taken as 0&nbsp;°F.  The second reference point was selected as the reading of the thermometer when it was placed in still water when ice was just forming on the surface.<ref name="why32">{{cite web|url=http://www.physlink.com/Education/AskExperts/ae64.cfm?CFID=21412834&CFTOKEN=55577927 |title=Why does the Fahrenheit scale use 32 degrees as a freezing point? |accessdate=9 May 2008 |last=Heath |first=Jonathan |publisher=PhysLink}}</ref> This was assigned as 30&nbsp;°F. The third calibration point, taken as 90&nbsp;°F, was selected as the thermometer's reading when the instrument was placed under the arm or in the mouth.<ref name="Burdge2014">{{cite book|last=Burdge|first=Julia|title=Chemistry: Atoms First|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2XVzCgAAQBAJ&pg=PA11|accessdate=16 September 2017|date=10 January 2014|publisher=McGraw-Hill|isbn=9780077646479|page=11}}</ref>

Fahrenheit came up with the idea that Mercury boils around 300 degrees on this [[temperature scale]]. Work by others showed that water boils about 180 degrees above its freezing point.  The Fahrenheit scale later was redefined to make the freezing-to-boiling interval exactly 180 degrees,<ref name="ftempsc">{{cite web|url=http://www.sizes.com/units/temperature_Fahrenheit.htm |title=Fahrenheit temperature scale |accessdate=9 May 2008 |date=10 December 2006 |publisher=Sizes, Inc}}</ref> a convenient value as 180 is a [[highly composite number]], meaning that it is evenly divisible into many fractions. It is because of the scale's redefinition that normal mean body temperature today is taken as 98.2 degrees,<ref>{{cite journal |doi=10.1001/jama.1992.03490120092034 |title=A Critical Appraisal of 98.6°F, the Upper Limit of the Normal Body Temperature, and Other Legacies of Carl Reinhold August Wunderlich |year=1992 |last1=MacKowiak |first1=Philip A. |journal=JAMA: The Journal of the American Medical Association |volume=268 |issue=12 |pages=1578–80 |pmid=1302471}}</ref> whereas it was 96 degrees on Fahrenheit's original scale.<ref>{{cite journal |last1=Elert |first1=Glenn |title=Temperature of a Healthy Human (Body Temperature) |url=http://hypertextbook.com/facts/1997/LenaWong.shtml |accessdate=4 December 2008 |doi=10.1046/j.1471-6712.2002.00069.x |year=2002 |journal=Scandinavian Journal of Caring Sciences |volume=16 |pages=122–8 |pmid=12000664 |last2=Forsberg |first2=C |last3=Wahren |first3=LK |issue=2}}</ref>

The [[Fahrenheit|Fahrenheit scale]] was the primary temperature standard for climatic, industrial and medical purposes in English-speaking countries until the 1970s, nowadays replaced by the [[Celsius|Celsius scale]] long used in the rest of the world, apart from the United States, where temperatures and weather reports are still broadcast in Fahrenheit.<ref>{{cite web |url= https://www.livescience.com/39916-fahrenheit.html |title= Fahrenheit: Facts, History & Conversion Formulas |first= Kim Ann |last= Zimmermann |date= 24 September 2013 |accessdate= 16 September 2017}}</ref>
