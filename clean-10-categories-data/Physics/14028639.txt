{{1r|date=March 2017}}The '''IEEE Heinrich Hertz Medal''' was a science award presented by the [[IEEE]] for outstanding achievements in the field of [[Electromagnetic radiation|electromagnetic waves]]. The medal was named in honour of German physicist [[Heinrich Hertz]], and was first proposed in 1986 by IEEE Region 8 ([[Germany]]) as a centennial recognition of Hertz's work on electromagnetic radiation theory from 1886 to 1891. The medal was first awarded in 1988, and was presented annually until 2001. It was officially discontinued in November 2009.
