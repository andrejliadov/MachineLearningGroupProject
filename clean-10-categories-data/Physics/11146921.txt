An '''acousto-optic deflector''' (AOD) spatially controls the optical beam.  In the operation of an acousto-optic deflector the power driving the acoustic transducer is kept on, at a constant level, while the acoustic frequency is varied to deflect the beam to different angular positions.  The acousto-optic deflector makes use of the acoustic frequency dependent diffraction angle, where a change in the angle <math>\Delta \theta_d</math> as a function of the change in frequency <math>\Delta f</math> given as,<ref>{{cite web

: <math> (12) \ \Delta \theta_d = \frac{\lambda}{\nu}\Delta f</math>

where <math>\lambda</math> is the optical wavelength and <math>\nu</math> is the velocity of the acoustic wave.

AOM technology has made practical the [[Boseâ€“Einstein condensation]] for which the 2001 [[Nobel Prize in Physics]] was awarded to [[Eric A. Cornell]], [[Wolfgang Ketterle]] and [[Carl E. Wieman]].<ref>[http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/physics/laureates/2001/illpres/ The Nobel Prize in Physics 2001<!-- Bot generated title -->]</ref> Another application of acoustic-optical deflection is optical trapping of small molecules.

AODs are essentially the same as [[acousto-optic modulator]]s (AOMs).  In both an AOM and an AOD, the amplitude and frequency of different orders are adjusted as light is diffracted.
