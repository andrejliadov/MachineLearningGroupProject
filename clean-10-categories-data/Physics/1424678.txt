The '''European Synchrotron Radiation Facility''' (ESRF) is a joint research facility situated in [[Grenoble]], [[France]], and supported by 22 countries (13 member countries: France, Germany, Italy, UK, Spain, Switzerland, Belgium, The Netherlands, Denmark, Finland, Norway, Sweden, Russia and 9 associate countries: Austria, Portugal, Israel, Poland, Czech Republic, Hungary, Slovakia, India and South Africa).<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esrf.eu/about/organisation/members-and-associates|title=Members and associates|publisher=ESRF}}</ref>

Some 8,000 scientists visit this [[particle accelerator]] each year, conducting upwards of 2,000 experiments and producing around 1,800 scientific publications.<ref>[http://www.nature.com/news/24-hours-at-the-x-ray-factory-1.19631 nature.com 29 March 2016, 24 hours at the X-ray factory.]</ref>

== History ==
Inaugurated in September 1994, it has an annual budget of around 100 million euros,<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esrf.eu/home/UsersAndScience/Publications/Highlights/highlights-2015/facts-and-figures.html|title=Facts and figures|publisher=ESRF}}</ref> employs over 630 people and is host to more than {{formatnum:7000}} visiting scientists each year.

In 2009, the ESRF began a first major improvement in its capacities. With the creation of the new ultra-stable experimental hall of  8,000 m² in 2015, its X-rays are 100 times more powerful, with a power of 100 billion times that of hospital radiography devices.<ref>[http://www.dpaonthenet.net/article/163487/World-s-brightest-X-ray-source-shuts-down-for-next-gen-100x-more-powerful.aspx dpaonthenet.net, World's brightest X-ray source shuts down for next-gen 100x more powerful.]</ref>

The second improvement to the facilities, now named the "Extremely Brilliant Source" (ESRF-EBS), took place between 2018 and 2020. and again improved its X-ray power by a factor of 100,<ref name="france3">{{in lang|fr}} [https://france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr/auvergne-rhone-alpes/isere/grenoble/grenoble-premier-faisceau-rayons-x-observe-synchrotron-nouvelle-generation-1781617.html france3-regions.francetvinfo.fr, Grenoble : le premier faisceau de rayons X observé dans le synchrotron nouvelle génération.]</ref> or 10,000 billion more powerful than X-rays used in the medical field. It became the first fourth-generation high-energy synchrotron in the world.<ref> [http://www.esrf.eu/AboutUs/Upgrade ESRF-EBS, The first high-energy fourth-generation synchrotron.]</ref>

The first electron beam tests began on January 30, 2020.<ref name="france3"></ref>  The facility reopened to users on August 25 of the same year.<ref>[https://ebs.esrf.fr/2020/08/25/esrf-ebs-opens-to-users/ ESRF-EBS opens to users]</ref>

== General description ==
[[Image:ESRF mg 2251.jpg|thumb|Top view of the ring]]
The ESRF [[physical plant]] consists of two main buildings: the experiment hall, containing the 844 metre circumference ring and forty tangential [[beamline]]s; and a block of [[laboratory|laboratories]], preparation suites, and offices connected to the ring by a pedestrian bridge. The [[Linear particle accelerator|linear accelerator]] [[electron gun]] and smaller booster ring used to bring the beam to an operating energy of 6 GeV are constructed within the main ring. Until recently bicycles were provided for use indoors in the ring's circumferential corridor. Unfortunately they have been removed after some minor accidents. But even before this it was not possible to cycle continuously all the way around, since some of the beamlines exit the hall.

Research at the ESRF focuses, in large part, on the use of [[X-ray]] radiation in fields as diverse as [[protein]] [[crystallography]], [[earth science]], [[paleontology]], [[materials science]], [[chemistry]] and [[physics]]. Facilities such as the ESRF offer a flux, energy range and resolution unachievable with conventional (laboratory) radiation sources.

== Study results ==
In 2014, ancient books destroyed by the [[eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79]] are read for the first time in the ESRF. These 1840 fragments were reduced to the status of charred cylinders.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.esrf.eu/home/news/general/content-news/general/ancient-books-destroyed-by-the-eruption-of-mount-vesuvius-read-for-the-very-first-time.html|title=Ancient books destroyed by the eruption of Mount Vesuvius 'read' for the very first time|publisher=}}</ref><ref>{{cite news|url=http://www.lemonde.fr/sciences/article/2015/01/20/des-papyrus-antiques-carbonises-dechiffres-a-la-lumiere-des-rayons-x_4559918_1650684.html|title=Des papyrus antiques carbonisés déchiffrés à la lumière des rayons X|newspaper=Le Monde|date=2015-01-20|language=fr}}</ref>

In 2015, scientists from the [[University of Sheffield]] have used the ESRF's X-rays to study the blue and white feathers of the [[Jay]] and have found that birds use well-controlled changes to the nanostructure of their [[feather]]s to create the vivid colours of their plumage. This research opens new possibilities for creating non-fading, synthetic colours for paints and clothing.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.sheffield.ac.uk/news/nr/jay-bird-feather-grey-nanostructure-university-1.535413|title=Nature's unique way of controlling colour explains why birds never go grey|work=sheffield.ac.uk}}</ref>

In July 2016, a team of [[South Africa]] researchers scans a complete fossilized skeleton of a small [[dinosaur]] discovered in 2005 in South Africa and older than 200 million years. The dentition of [[heterodontosauridae]] scanned revealed palate bones of less than a millimeter thick.<ref>[http://www.htxt.co.za/2016/07/27/sa-fossil-scanned-largest-x-ray-machine/ htxt.co.za Tiny Karoo fossil scanned by world’s largest X-ray machine.]</ref><ref>[https://www.bbc.com/news/science-environment-36901907 bbc.com Paul Rincon, X-rays reveal complete dino skeleton.]</ref>

On December 6, 2017, the journal [[Nature (journal)|Nature]] unveils the discovery at the European synchrotron of a new species of dinosaur with surprising characteristics and living about 72 million years ago. It is a biped, mix between a [[velociraptor]], an ostrich and a swan with a crocodile muzzle and penguin wings. With a height of about 1.2 meters (4&nbsp;ft) and with killer claws, he could hunt his prey on the ground or hunt by swimming in the water, which is a novelty for scientists in the study of dinosaurs.<ref>[https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2017-12/esrf-ssl120417.php www.eurekalert.org, Synchrotron sheds light on the amphibious lifestyle of a new raptorial dinosaur.]</ref>

== Access ==

The ESRF site forms part of the "[[Polygone Scientifique]]", lying at the confluence of the rivers [[Drac (river)|Drac]] and [[Isère (river)|Isère]] about 1.5&nbsp;km from the centre of [[Grenoble]]. It is served by [[Grenoble tramway]] system and local bus lines of Semitag (C6, 22 and 54). It is served by [[Grenoble–Isère Airport]] and [[Lyon–Saint-Exupéry Airport]].

The ESRF shares its site with several other institutions including the [[Institut Laue-Langevin]] (ILL), the [[European Molecular Biology Laboratory]] (EMBL) and the [[LNCMI]]. The [[Centre national de la recherche scientifique]] (CNRS) has an [http://www.grenoble.cnrs.fr institute] just across the road.
