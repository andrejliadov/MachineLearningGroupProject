The '''Oxford Calculators''' were a group of 14th-century thinkers, almost all associated with [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]]; for this reason they were dubbed "The Merton School". These men took a strikingly [[Logic|logical]] and [[Mathematical proof|mathematical]] approach to [[Philosophy|philosophical]] problems.
The key "calculators", writing in the second quarter of the 14th century, were [[Thomas Bradwardine]], [[William Heytesbury]], [[Richard Swineshead]] and [[John Dumbleton]].
These men built on the slightly earlier work of [[Walter Burley]] and [[Gerard of Brussels]].

==Science==
The advances these men made were initially purely mathematical but later became relevant to mechanics. They used [[Aristotle|Aristotelian]] logic and physics. They also studied and attempted to quantify every physical and observable characteristic, like heat, force, color, density, and light. Aristotle believed that only length and motion were able to be quantified. But they used his philosophy and proved it untrue by being able to calculate things such as temperature and power.<ref>Agutter, Paul S.; Wheatley, Denys N. (2008) "Thinking About Life"</ref>
They developed [[Al-Battani]]'s work on trigonometry and their most famous work was the development of the [[mean speed theorem]], (though it was later credited to [[Galileo]]) which is known as "The Law of Falling Bodies".<ref>Gavroglu, Kostas; Renn, Jurgen (2007) "Positioning the History of Science"</ref> Although they attempted to quantify these observable characteristics, their interests lay more in the philosophical and logical aspects than in natural world. They used numbers to disagree philosophically and prove the reasoning of "why" something worked the way it did and not only "how" something functioned the way that it did.<ref>{{cite book|title=Thinking About Life|publisher=Springer|isbn=978-1-4020-8865-0|editor=Paul S. Agutter, and Denys N. Wheatley}}</ref>

The Oxford Calculators distinguished [[kinematics]] from [[dynamics (mechanics)|dynamics]], emphasizing kinematics, and investigating instantaneous velocity. They first formulated the [[mean speed theorem]]: ''a body moving with constant velocity travels the same distance as an accelerated body in the same time if its velocity is half the final speed of the accelerated body''.

The mathematical physicist and historian of science [[Clifford Truesdell]], wrote:<ref>Clifford Truesdell, ''Essays in The History of Mechanics'', (Springer-Verlag, New York, 1968)</ref>

{{blockquote|The now published sources prove to us, beyond contention, that the main kinematical properties of uniformly accelerated motions, still attributed to [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] by the physics texts, were discovered and proved by scholars of Merton college.... In principle, the qualities of Greek physics were replaced, at least for motions, by the numerical quantities that have ruled Western science ever since. The work was quickly diffused into [[France]], [[Italy]], and other parts of [[Europe]]. Almost immediately, [[Giovanni di Casali|Giovanni di Casale]] and [[Nicole Oresme]] found how to represent the results by geometrical [[Graph of a function|graphs]], introducing the connection between [[geometry]] and the physical world that became a second characteristic habit of Western thought ...}}

In ''Tractatus de proportionibus'' (1328), Bradwardine extended the theory of proportions of [[Eudoxus of Cnidus|Eudoxus]] to anticipate the concept of [[exponential growth]], later developed by the [[Jakob Bernoulli|Bernoulli]] and [[Euler]], with [[interest|compound interest]] as a special case. Arguments for the mean speed theorem (above) require the modern concept of [[Limit (mathematics)|limit]], so Bradwardine had to use arguments of his day. Mathematician and mathematical historian [[Carl Benjamin Boyer]] writes, "Bradwardine developed the [[Boethius|Boethian]] theory of double or triple or, more generally, what we would call 'n-tuple' proportion".<ref>{{cite book |author=Carl B. Boyer, [[Uta Merzbach|Uta C. Merzbach]]|title=A History of Mathematics|url=https://archive.org/details/AHistoryOfMathematics}}</ref>

Boyer also writes that "the works of Bradwardine had contained some fundamentals of [[trigonometry]]". Yet "Bradwardine and his Oxford colleagues did not quite make the breakthrough to modern science."<ref>{{cite book |author=Norman F. Cantor|title=In the Wake of the Plague: The Black Death and the World it Made

==Thomas Bradwardine==
[[Thomas Bradwardine]] was born in 1290 in [[Sussex]], England. An attending student educated at [[Balliol College, Oxford]], he earned various degrees. He was a secular cleric, a scholar, a [[theologist]], a [[mathematician]], and a [[physicist]]. He became chancellor of the diocese of London and Dean of St Paul's, as well as chaplain and confessor to Edward III. During his time at Oxford, he authored many books including: ''De Geometria Speculativa'' (printed in Paris, 1530), ''De Arithmetica Practica'' (printed in Paris, 1502), and ''De Proportionibus Velocitatum in Motibus'' (printed in Paris in 1495).

Aristotle suggested that velocity was proportional to force and inversely proportional to resistance, doubling the force would double the velocity but doubling the resistance would halve the velocity (V&nbsp;∝&nbsp;F/R). Bradwardine objected saying that this is not observed because the velocity does not equal zero when the resistance exceeds the force. Instead, he proposed a new theory that, in modern terms, would be written as (V&nbsp;∝&nbsp;log&nbsp;F/R), which was widely accepted until the late sixteenth century.<ref name="autogenerated1">{{cite web|author=Mark Thakkar|title=The Oxford Calculators|year=2007|url=https://www.academia.edu/2905457|magazine=Oxford Today}}</ref>

==William Heytesbury==
[[William of Heytesbury|William Heytesbury]] was a [[bursar]] at [[Merton College, Oxford|Merton]] until the late 1330s and he administered the college properties in [[Northumberland]]. Later in his life he was a chancellor of Oxford. He was the first to discover the mean-speed theorem, later "The Law of Falling Bodies". Unlike Bradwardine's theory, the theorem, also known as "The Merton Rule" is a probable truth.<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
His most noted work was ''Regulae Solvendi Sophismata'' (Rules for Solving Sophisms). ''Sophisma'' is a statement which one can argue to be both true and false. The resolution of these arguments and determination of the real state of affairs forces one to deal with logical matters such as the analysis of the meaning of the statement in question, and the application of logical rules to specific cases. An example would be the statement, "The compound H<sub>2</sub>O is both a solid and a liquid". When the temperature is low enough this statement is true. But it may be argued and proven false at a higher temperature. In his time, this work was logically advanced.
He was a second generation calculator. He built on Richard Klivingston's "Sophistimata and Bradwardine's "Insolubilia". Later, his work went on to influence Peter of Mantura and [[Paul of Venice]].<ref>{{cite web|last=Longeway|first=John|title=William Heytesbury|url=http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/heytesbury/|publisher=Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy}}</ref>

==Richard Swineshead==
[[Richard Swineshead]] was also an English [[mathematician]], [[logician]], and [[natural philosopher]]. The sixteenth-century polymath [[Girolamo Cardano]] placed him in the top-ten intellects of all time, alongside [[Archimedes]], [[Aristotle]], and [[Euclid]].<ref name="autogenerated1"/>
He became a member of the Oxford calculators in 1344. His main work was a series of treatises written in 1350. This work earned him the title of "The Calculator". His treatises were named ''Liber Calculationum'', which means "Book of Calculations". His book dealt in exhaustive detail with quantitative physics and he had over fifty variations of [[Thomas Bradwardine|Bradwardine]]'s law.

==John Dumbleton==
[[John Dumbleton]] became a member of the calculators in 1338–39. After becoming a member, he left the calculators for a brief period of time to study theology in Paris in 1345–47. After his study there he returned to his work with the calculators in 1347–48. One of his main pieces of work, ''Summa logicae et philosophiae naturalis'', focused on explaining the natural world in a coherent and realistic manner, unlike some of his colleagues, claiming that they were making light of serious endeavors.<ref>{{Cite journal|last=Molland|first=George|date=23 September 2004|title=Dumbleton, John|journal=Oxford Dictionary of National Biography}}</ref>
