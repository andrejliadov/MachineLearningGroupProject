'''George Robert Carruthers''' (born October 1, 1939) is an American inventor, [[physicist]], [[engineer]] and [[space scientist]]. Carruthers invented the [[Spectrograph|ultraviolet camera/spectrograph]] for [[NASA]] to use when it launched [[Apollo 16]] in 1972. His work also demonstrated that [[molecular]] [[hydrogen]] exists in the [[interstellar medium]]. In 2003, Carruthers was inducted into the [[National Inventors Hall of Fame|National Inventor's Hall of Fame]]. He received an [[Honorary degree|honorary doctorate]] for [[Engineering]] from [[Michigan Technological University]].

==Biography==
Carruthers, who is [[African-American]], was born October 1, 1939, in [[Cincinnati]], [[Ohio]] to George and Sophia Carruthers.<ref name=":0">{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/george-carruthers-538794|title=George Carruthers|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-04-23}}</ref><ref name="Carru1">{{cite web|url=http://www.blackinventor.com/pages/george-carruthers.html|title=George Carruthers|author=|year=2011|work=Inventors|publisher=The Black Inventor On-Line Museum|accessdate=13 November 2011}}</ref> His father was a civil engineer and his mother was a homemaker and his family initially lived in [[Milford, Ohio]]. At an early age George developed an interest in physics, science and [[astronomy]], which his father encouraged. At the age of 10 he built his first telescope out of cardboard tubing and lenses purchased using money he earned as a delivery boy.<ref name=":0" />

His father died when Carruthers was 12, and at that time his family moved to the [[South side Chicago|South Side]] of [[Chicago]] where he stayed until he went to college.<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.aip.org/history-programs/niels-bohr-library/oral-histories/32485|title=George Carruthers|date=2015-01-12|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}</ref> He did not perform well in school at a young age, earning poor grades in math and physics. However, he won three separate science fair awards during this time.<ref name=":0" /> Also as a child, he enjoyed visiting Chicago museums, libraries and the [[Adler Planetarium]] that caused him to be an avid science-fiction reader and enjoyed constructing model rockets. Later he became a member of the Chicago Rocket Society and various science clubs.<ref name="Carru1" />

After graduating from [[Englewood Technical Prep Academy|Englewood High School]],<ref name="Carru1" /> he entered the College of Engineering at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign]], and received a [[Bachelor of Science|Bachelor of Science degree]] in [[Aerospace engineering|aeronautical engineering]] in 1961. Carruthers did his graduate work at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign|University of Illinois]] and earned [[Master's degree]] in [[nuclear engineering]] in 1962. Carruthers received a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in aeronautical and astronautical engineering in 1964. While conducting his graduate studies, Carruthers worked as researcher and teaching assistant studying plasma and gases.<ref name="Carru1" />

During the 1980s, Carruthers helped create a program called the [[Science & Engineers Apprentice Program]], which allows high school students to spend a summer working with scientists at the [[United States Naval Research Laboratory|Naval Research Laboratory]]. Carruthers now works with NRL's community outreach organization, and as such helps support several educational activities in the sciences in the [[Washington D.C.]] area.

Since 1983 he has been Chairman of the Editing and Review Committee and Editor, ''Journal of the [[National Technical Association]]''.

During the summers of 1996 and 1997 he taught a course in Earth and Space Science for D.C. Public Schools Science teachers. He also helped develop a series of videotapes on Earth and Space science for high-school students.

Since 2002, Carruthers has been teaching a two-semester course in Earth and Space Science at [[Howard University]] sponsored by a NASA Aerospace Workforce Development Grant.

On February 12, 2009, Carruthers was honored as a Distinguished Lecturer at the [[Office of Naval Research]] for his achievements in the field of space science.

On February 1, 2013, Dr. Carruthers was awarded the 2012 [[National Medal of Technology and Innovation]] by President [[Barack Obama]] at the [[White House]].<ref>{{cite web|url=http://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2013/dr-george-carruthers-honored-with-national-medal-of-technology-and-innovation|title=NRL's Dr. George Carruthers Honored with National Medal of Technology and Innovation|accessdate=3 May 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216104022/http://www.nrl.navy.mil/media/news-releases/2013/dr-george-carruthers-honored-with-national-medal-of-technology-and-innovation|archive-date=16 February 2013|url-status=dead}}</ref>

He is a member of the [[American Astronomical Society]], the [[American Geophysical Union]], the [[American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics]], the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] and the [[National Society of Black Physicists]].

He has lived most of his life in [[Washington, DC]].<ref name="Interview">{{cite news|url=http://capecosmos.org|title=producer, "Race and the Space Race"|last=Paul|first=Richard|date=June 15, 2009}}</ref>

===Inventions and discoveries===
Carruthers is considered the inventor of the [[Spectrograph|ultraviolet camera/spectrograph]].<ref name=":0" /> His work with the spectrograph also demonstrated incontrovertible proof that [[molecular]] [[hydrogen]] exists in the [[interstellar medium]].<ref>{{Cite news|url=https://www.nasa.gov/image-feature/looking-back-dr-george-carruthers-and-apollo-16-far-ultraviolet-cameraspectrograph|title=Dr. George Carruthers and Apollo 16 Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph|last=Loff|first=Sarah|date=2017-02-02|work=NASA|access-date=2018-04-23|language=en}}</ref><ref>[[Abdul Alkalimat|Alkalimat, Abdul]] (2004).

[[File:Far Ultraviolet Camera Spectrograph.jpg|thumb|telescope developed by Dr. Carruthers on display at the National Air and Space Museum]]In 1964, Carruthers began employment for the [[U.S. Naval Research Laboratory]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], where his work focused on far ultraviolet astronomy.<ref name="Carru1" /> 1969 was the year he received a patent for his invention, the "Image Converter," which detected electromagnetic radiation in short wavelengths,<ref name="Carru1" /> and in 1970, he made the first examination of molecular hydrogen in space.

Two years later, Carruthers invented the first moon-based observatory, the [[Far Ultraviolet Camera/Spectrograph]], which was used in the [[Apollo 16]] mission.<ref name="Carru1" /> In 1986, one of Carruthers' inventions captured an ultraviolet image of [[Halley's Comet]]. In 1991, he invented a camera that was used in the [[Space Shuttle]] Mission.
