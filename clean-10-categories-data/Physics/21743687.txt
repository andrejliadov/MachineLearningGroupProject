In [[theoretical physics]], '''back-reaction''' (or '''backreaction''') is often necessary to calculate the self-consistent behaviour of a [[Elementary particle|particle]] or an object in an external field.

==Intuitive definition==
When a particle is considered to have no mass or to have an [[infinitesimal]] charge, this can be described as saying that we deal with a probe and that back-reaction is neglected. However, a real object also carries (in general) a mass and a charge itself. These properties imply that the model of the original environment needs to be modified to reach self-consistency. For example, a particle can be described as helping to curve the space in [[general relativity]]. Taking into account the constraints implied on the model by the particle's properties – the back-reaction – is one way of reaching a more accurate model than if those constraints are ignored.

==Cosmology==
In [[inhomogeneous cosmology]], in which structure formation is taken into account in a general-relativistic model of the Universe, the term "backreaction" is used for a measure of the non-commutativity of the averaging procedure
:<math>G_{\mu\nu}(\overline{g_{\alpha\beta}}) \neq \overline{G_{\mu\nu}(g_{\alpha\beta})} = \frac{8\pi G}{c^4}\overline{T_{\mu\nu}}</math>
(which comes from the non-linearity of Einstein field equations) and the dynamical evolution of spatial slices of space-time.<ref name="Buchert2008GRGreview" />
{{As of|2017}}, the role of backreaction in possibly leading to an alternative to [[dark energy]] is an open question of debate among cosmologists.<ref name="Buchert11" /><ref name="Buchert11_CQGplus" />  The existence of a homogeneity length scale can be considered to be that at which the calculations with and without backreaction give the same results. {{As of|2017}}, the existence of such a scale needs experimental confirmation.<ref name="Buchert2008GRGreview" />
