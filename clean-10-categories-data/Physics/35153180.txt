PlanetPhysics was also a [[free content|free]], collaborative, online [[physics]], [[mathematical physics]],<ref>[http://store.elsevier.com/categoryController.jsp;jsessionid=306C24FE20EF10B217120B89AD1B5D65.psc1705_b2cst_001?flagName=search&categoryName=Mathematics%20and%20Statistics%7CApplied%20Mathematics&catParentId=EST_SA-6&frPag=SA&locale=en_US] Physics and Mathematical Physics Sources online</ref> [[computational physics]] and [[mathematics|physical mathematics]] project, including original articles, lectures, books and  [[encyclopedia]] entries.  The emphasis was on openness, [[pedagogy]], real-time content, rigour, interlinked content, and also based on a virtual [[community]], or virtual group, of about 600 people with various physics, mathematical physics, physical mathematics, logic (such as quantum logic, relational logic and many-valued logics), axiomatics and mathematics interests.

==Content==

The main PlanetPhysics.org focus was on both original research and [[encyclopedia|encyclopedic]] entries; with over 3,400 physics and mathematics concepts edited in [[LaTeX]] and rendered in [[HTML]], the PlanetPhysics Encyclopedia is at present the largest Physics encyclopedia written in LaTeX, containing both introductory as well as advanced level presentations. Moreover, its sections on papers and expositions, are second only to [[CERN]] and [[arXiv]] physics preprint archives.

In addition, the PlanetPhysics.org new websites also included extensive graphics illustrations of physics experiments, and also forum discussions. The emphasis was on modern physics contents, including advanced physics and mathematical physics concepts as well.

The project hosted data containing physics, applied physics, engineering and mathematics books, lectures, preprints and research-level papers. A system for both private and semi-private messaging among users was also in place.

{{As of|2012|05|15}}, the Physics and Mathematical Physics projects hosted over 2,000 entries, containing more than 30,000 ''concepts'' in books, lectures, expositions, encyclopedia entries, and papers. Several Wikipedia entries also incorporate text from PlanetPhysics articles, and ''vice versa'', several PlanetPhysics articles contain links or refer to Wikipedia entries.

===Content development models===

PlanetPhysics implemented several specific content creation systems based on the ''Noosphere versions 1.0/1.5'', ''Planetary'' (powered by [[Drupal]]), and [[MediaWiki]] currently being updated to allow peer-to-peer review, as well as preprints and encyclopedic contributions. This was significantly different from the so-called ''authority model'' previously adopted by [[PlanetMath]].<ref>[http://planetmath.org/?op=getobj&from=collab&id=34] Noosphere's authority model</ref> Only registered users could create and edit their own entries, or contribute jointly, by agreement, to various topical entries. The [[MediaWiki]] ''version 1.17'' approach was mostly utilized at PlanetPhysics for creating books, uploading PDF files of open access articles, and also for graphics-intensive physics animations and graphical applications to physical problems.<ref>[http://wiki.planetphysics.info/index.php/Main_Page  ''MediaWiki version 1.17'' Applications Main page at PlanetPhysics.org]</ref>

An author who published a new article with ''Noosphere version 1.5'' (created by Aaron Krowne) retains intellectual property ownership of that entry, and is the only person authorized to edit that article, unless the author allows other contributors to edit as part of an editor group selected by the author.  Other users could, however, add corrections and discuss improvements that must be approved by the original author so that the resulting modifications of the article, if any, were always made by the owner.  When there are long lasting (>30 days) unresolved necessary corrections, either the ownership or the entry could be removed by the web site administration.

A major strength of the ''Noosphere'' versions 1.0 and 1.5 ''planetphysics.us'' website is its capability of linking in real time conceptually related entries, as well as automatically listing all the concepts either defined by the article or related to the article in the Physics and Mathematical Physics encyclopedia.  Any PlanetPhysics contributor can explicitly create links to other articles, and the Noosphere 1.0 system also automatically turns certain words into links to the defining articles. The topic area of every article is classified by either the [[Physics and Astronomy Classification Scheme]] (PACS) or the [[Mathematics Subject Classification]] (MSC).
