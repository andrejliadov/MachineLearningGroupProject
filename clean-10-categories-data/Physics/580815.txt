The '''International Union of Pure and Applied Physics''' ('''IUPAP''' {{IPAc-en|ˈ|aɪ|juː|p|æ|p|,_|ˈ|juː|-}}) is an international [[non-governmental organization]] whose mission is to assist in the worldwide development of [[physics]], to foster international cooperation in physics, and to help in the application of physics toward solving problems of concern to humanity.<ref name="Kerwin1969"></ref><ref name="Nilsson1996">{{cite journal|last1=Nilsson|first1=Jan|title=What can IUPAP do for you?|journal=Physics World|volume=9|issue=12|year=1996|pages=13–14|issn=0953-8585|doi=10.1088/2058-7058/9/12/12}}</ref>

IUPAP is a member of the [[International Council for Science]] (ICSU).

== History==
In 1919 was formed the International Research Council<ref>{{Cite web|url=http://iupap.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/04/history.pdf|title=History of IUPAP|website=iupap.org}}</ref> “largely through the representatives of the [[National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences, Washington]], and of the [[Royal Society]], [[London]], to coordinate international efforts in the different branches of sciences, under whose aegis international associations or unions in different branches of science could be formed".

In accordance with this principle, the 1922 General Assembly of the IRC convened at [[Brussels]] and a number of physicists present decided that the formation of a Physics Union was imperative.

Thirteen countries([[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[France]], [[Netherlands]], [[Empire of Japan]], [[Norway]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]], [[United Kingdom]], [[United States]] and [[Union of South Africa]]) immediately announced their adherence to the new Union.

An Executive committee was formed which undertook to prepare rules, regulations, and activities of the organization. The committee consisted of ten distinguished physicists:- [[William Henry Bragg|W.H. Bragg]], M. Brillouin, [[Orso Mario Corbino|O.M. Corbino]], M. Knudsen, M. Leblanc, [[Robert Andrews Millikan|R.A. Millikan]], H. Nagaoka, E. Van Aubel, and H. Abraham. The committee had Bragg as President, Van Aubel as Vice-President, and Abraham as Secretary.

This was the birth of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics.

== Committees and governance ==
The Union is governed by its General Assembly, which meets every three years. The Council is its top executive body, supervising the activities of the nineteen specialized International Commissions and the four Affiliated Commissions – it typically meets once or twice per year. The Union is composed of Members representing identified physics communities. At present 60 Members adhere to IUPAP. The Members are represented by Liaison Committees.  Members of the Council and Commissions are elected by the General Assembly, based on nominations received from Liaison Committees and existing Council and Commission members.<ref>{{cite web |url=https://iupap.org/about%2Dus/statutes/ |title=The Statues of the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (as adopted by the General Assembly, 2011) |date=2011 |publisher=IUPAP |access-date=2019-03-26 |archive-date=2019-03-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20190326143613/http://iupap.org/about-us/statutes/ |url-status=dead }}</ref>

AC.3. [[International Commission for Acoustics]]

AC.4. [https://iupap.org/commissions/affiliated-commissions/ac4-international-commission-on-medical-physics/ International Commission on Medical Physics]

In addition IUPAP has established a number of Working Groups to provide an overview of important areas of international collaboration in physics.

== Sponsored conferences ==
Each year, IUPAP endorses approximately 30 international conferences and awards grants to the majority of them. Applications for sponsorship can be made via the IUPAP website.

Sponsored conferences fall into four categories:

'''General Conferences - Type A'''

These provide a broad overview of an entire field (typically the field of interest to a Commission), and normally occur at two- or three-year intervals, as advances in the field warrant. Attendance in the range of 750-1000 would be anticipated.

'''Topical Conferences - Type B'''

These concentrate on broad sub-fields (e.g. nuclear spectroscopy, nuclear reaction mechanisms, heavy ion physics, are possible sub-fields in the field of Nuclear Physics). They would normally be scheduled in the years between the corresponding Type A General conferences. Attendance in the range of 300-600 would be anticipated.

'''Special Conferences - Type C'''

These concentrate on much more specialised topics than in the case of Type B Conferences (e.g. angular correlations, lifetime measurements, neutron resonance studies in the field of Nuclear Physics). Attendance in the range of 50-200 would be anticipated.

'''Workshops in Developing Countries - Type D'''

These concentrate on meeting the needs of a developing region. Unlike the Type A, B and C conferences, they do not need to be truly international, but should involve neighbouring countries, and they should address the needs of the region. One Type D conference will be approved each year. All applications for Type-D Conferences must be submitted to the Commission on Physics for Development (C13).

== Sponsored awards ==
IUPAP commissions sponsor various awards for scientists. These include:

* The IUPAP Young Scientist Prize, approved and adopted at the 2005 General Assembly for all commissions.
* The SUNAMCO Medal, given by the Commission on Symbols, Units, Nomenclature, Atomic Masses and Fundamental Constants (C2) 
* The Boltzmann Medal, awarded by the Commission on Statistical Physics (C3) 
* The Fritz London Award, given by the Commission on Low Temperature Physics (C5)  
* The Young Author Best Paper Award, established by the Commission on Semiconductors (C8) and sponsored by the semiconductor industries of USA, Japan and Europe 
* ICM Award in Magnetism, established by the Commission on Magnetism (C9) 
* The ICPE Medal, sponsored by the Commission on Physics Education (C14) 
* Penning Award Excellence in Low-Temperature Plasma Physics, established by the Commission on Plasma Physics (C16)
* ICO Prize, awarded by the Affiliated Commission for Optics (AC1)  
* ICO Galileo Galilei Award, awarded by the Affiliated Commission for Optics (AC1)

== Sponsored symposiums==
* [[Symposium on Laser Physics]]

== Member States of IUPAP ==

IUPAP was founded  by 13 states:- Belgium, Canada, Denmark, France, Netherlands, Empire of Japan, Norway, Poland, Spain, Switzerland, United Kingdom, United States and Union of South Africa in 1922. Since then many new members have joined the union.Today the IUPAP consists of 56 member states.

== List of IUPAP Presidents ==

The IUPAP President is the head of the Executive Council. IUPAP Presidents are elected by the General Assembly. During the election of the Executive Council, the future President is also elected to the post of President-Designate. Thus in every Executive Council the current President-Designate will succeed the incumbent President.

Below is the list of IUPAC Presidents since its inception in 1922.
