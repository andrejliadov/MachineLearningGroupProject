The '''American Crystallographic Association, Inc.''' ('''ACA''') is a non-profit, scientific organization for scientists who study the structure of matter via [[Crystallography|crystallographic]] methodologies. Since its founding in 1949 it has amassed over 2000 members worldwide.

The association meets annually in July and has several interest groups dealing with specific aspects of crystallography, including
[[fiber diffraction]], [[neutron scattering]] and [[powder diffraction]].

A quarterly magazine, called ''ACA RefleXions'', is published in addition to a scholarly journal. ''Structural Dynamics'' is a peer-reviewed, open access, online-only journal co-published by ACA and AIP Publishing. It highlights research articles on structural determination and dynamics of systems, enabled by the emerging new instruments (e.g. XFELs, high harmonic generation, ultra-short electron sources, etc.) and new experimental and theoretical methodologies. The journal is accepting short communications, topical reviews, and research papers in the following topics: Experimental Methodologies, Theory and Modeling, Surfaces and Interfaces, Materials, Liquids and Solutions, and Biological Systems.

The association presents several awards<ref>{{cite web |url=http://www.amercrystalassn.org/content/pages/main-award-descriptions |title=Awards Presented by the American Crystallographic Association |publisher=American Crystallographic Association |accessdate=29 March 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100405073425/http://www.amercrystalassn.org/content/pages/main-award-descriptions |archive-date=5 April 2010 |url-status=dead |df=dmy-all }}</ref>
