{{about|the NOVOFER Foundation award||Dennis Gabor Award (disambiguation)}}
{{peacock|section|date=January 2020}}
The '''International Dennis Gabor Award''' is awarded by the [[NOVOFER Foundation]] of the [[Hungarian Academy of Sciences]] for outstanding scientific achievements with practical applications, with a clear positive attitude towards international cooperation of the researchers. It is named after the [[Nobel Prize]] winner [[Dennis Gabor]]. The award includes a 130&nbsp;mm-diameter pure silver medal with a hologram of Dennis Gabor’s portrait, a charter of honor, and a monetary prize.<ref name=sigmaxi>{{cite web | archive-date=2004-10-31 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20041031152847/http://www.sigmaxi.org/programs/international/novofer.pdf | url=http://www.sigmaxi.org/programs/international/novofer.pdf | title=Call for 2003 International Dennis Gabor Award | url-status=dead | website=sigmaxi.org}}</ref><ref>{{cite web | access-date=2019-09-10 | title=Az Alapítványról | trans-title=About the Foundation | url=http://www.gabordenes.hu/az-alapitvanyrol/ | language=hu | website=Gábor Dénes Díj}}</ref> The award is normally awarded simultaneously to a Hungarian and to a non-Hungarian researcher and is not awarded every year but rather every 3 years or longer depending on the level of candidates for the award. The award is an honor to [[Dennis Gabor]] and aims at identifying researchers with a likewise successful early career path as [[Dennis Gabor]] himself. Because of the high prestige of this award and the broad research area covered, selection of the awardee is extremely competitive, even more so for the non-Hungarian nominees. The award ceremony takes place at the Hungarian Parliament.

A different '''Dennis Gabor Award''' is presented each year by SPIE, the international society for optics and photonics,<ref>{{cite web | title=Dennis Gabor Award | website=SPIE | url=http://spie.org/about-spie/awards-programs/current-award-winners/award-categories-and-past-winners/dennis-gabor | access-date=2019-09-10}}</ref> in recognition of outstanding accomplishments in diffractive wavefront technologies, especially those which further the development of holography and metrology applications.
