Much insight in [[quantum mechanics]] can be gained from understanding the [[closed-form solution]]s to the time-dependent non-relativistic [[Schrödinger equation]]. It takes the form

:<math>
\hat{H} \psi\left(\mathbf{r}, t\right) =
\left[ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V\left(\mathbf{r}\right) \right] \psi\left(\mathbf{r}, t\right) = i\hbar \frac{\partial\psi\left(\mathbf{r}, t\right)}{\partial t},
</math>

where <math>\psi</math> is the [[wave function]] of the system, <math>\hat{H}</math> is the [[Hamiltonian operator]], and <math>t</math> is time. [[Stationary state]]s of this equation are found by solving the time-independent  Schrödinger equation,

:<math>
\left[ - \frac{\hbar^2}{2m} \nabla^2 + V\left(\mathbf{r}\right) \right] \psi\left(\mathbf{r}\right) = E \psi \left(\mathbf{r}\right),
</math>

which is an eigenvalue equation. Very often, only numerical solutions to the Schrödinger equation can be found for a given physical system and its associated potential energy. However, there exists a subset of physical systems for which the form of the eigenfunctions and their associated energies, or eigenvalues, can be found. These quantum-mechanical systems with analytical solutions are listed below.
