'''''Acta Physica Polonica''''' is an [[open access]] [[peer-reviewed]] [[scientific journal]] covering research in [[physics]]. It was established by the [[Polish Physical Society]] in 1920. In 1970 is split into two journals  ''Acta Physica Polonica A'' and ''Acta Physica Polonica B''. The two journals became independent in 1995, with series A published by the [http://www.ifpan.edu.pl/index_en.php Institute of Physics] of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]] and series B published by the [[Jagiellonian University]] in cooperation with the [[Polish Academy of Learning|Polish Academy of Arts and Sciences]].

==History==
''Acta Physica Polonica'' was established by the [[Polish Physical Society]] in 1920. In 1970 it was split into ''Acta Physica Polonica A'' (published by the [http://www.ifpan.edu.pl/index_en.php Institute of Physics] of the [[Polish Academy of Sciences]]), whose scope includes general physics, [[atomic physics|atomic]] and [[molecular physics|molecular]] physics, [[condensed matter]] physics, [[optics]] and [[quantum optics]], [[biophysics]], [[quantum information]], and [[applied physics]], and ''Acta Physica Polonica B'' (published by the [[Jagiellonian University]]), which covers [[mathematical physics]], [[particle physics|particle]] and [[nuclear physics]], [[theory of relativity|relativity]], [[astrophysics]], and [[statistical physics]]. The [[editors-in-chief]] are Jan Mostowski and [[Michał Praszałowicz]]. In 2008, ''Acta Physica Polonica B Proceedings Supplement'' was established.

==Abstracting and Indexing==
''Acta Physica Polonica A'' has a 2013 [[impact factor]] of 0.604, while the ''B'' series has an impact factor of 0.998.<ref name="WoS">{{Citation | title = Web of Science | year = 2013 | url = http://isiwebofknowledge.com | accessdate =30 July 2014}}</ref> ''Acta Physica Polonica B'' is part of the [[SCOAP3|SCOAP<sup>3</sup>]] initiative.<ref>
