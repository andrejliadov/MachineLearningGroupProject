{{Continuum mechanics |laws}}
In [[physics]] and [[chemistry]], the '''law of conservation of energy''' states that the total [[energy]] of an [[isolated system]] remains constant; it is said to be [[Conservation law|''conserved'']] over time.<ref name=Feynman2Ch1S2>{{cite book |author=Richard Feynman |title=The Feynman Lectures on Physics Vol I |publisher=Addison Wesley  |year=1970 |isbn=978-0-201-02115-8  |url=http://www.feynmanlectures.caltech.edu/I_04.html}}</ref> This law, first proposed and tested by [[Émilie du Châtelet]], means that energy can neither be created nor destroyed; rather, it can only be transformed or transferred from one form to another. For instance, [[chemical energy]] is [[Energy conversion|converted]] to [[kinetic energy]] when a stick of [[dynamite]] explodes. If one adds up all forms of energy that were released in the explosion, such as the [[kinetic energy]] and [[potential energy]] of the pieces, as well as heat and sound, one will get the exact decrease of chemical energy in the combustion of the dynamite.  Classically, conservation of energy was distinct from [[conservation of mass]]; however, [[special relativity]] showed that mass is related to energy and vice versa by ''E = mc<sup>2</sup>'', and science now takes the view that mass–energy as a whole is conserved. Theoretically, this implies that any object with mass can itself be converted to pure energy, and vice versa, though this is believed to be possible only under the most extreme of physical conditions, such as likely existed in the universe [[Grand unification epoch|very shortly after the Big Bang]] or when [[Black hole|black holes]] emit [[Hawking radiation]].

Conservation of energy can be rigorously proven by [[Noether's theorem]] as a consequence of [[Continuous function|continuous]] [[time translation symmetry]]; that is, from the fact that the laws of physics do not change over time.

A consequence of the law of conservation of energy is that a [[Perpetual motion#Classification|perpetual motion machine of the first kind]] cannot exist, that is to say, no system without an external energy supply can deliver an unlimited amount of energy to its surroundings.<ref>Planck, M.

==History==
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
[[Ancient]] [[philosopher]]s as far back as [[Thales of Miletus]] {{circa}}&nbsp;550 BCE had inklings of the conservation of some underlying substance of which everything is made. However, there is no particular reason to identify their theories with what we know today as "mass-energy" (for example, Thales thought it was water). [[Empedocles]] (490–430 BCE) wrote that in his universal system, composed of [[Classical element|four roots]] (earth, air, water, fire), "nothing comes to be or perishes";<ref>{{cite journal|last=Janko|first=Richard|title=Empedocles, "On Nature"|journal=Zeitschrift für Papyrologie und Epigraphik|year=2004 |volume=150 |pages=1–26|url=http://ancphil.lsa.umich.edu/-/downloads/faculty/janko/empedocles-nature.pdf }}</ref> instead, these elements suffer continual rearrangement. [[Epicurus]] ({{circa}}&nbsp;350 BCE) on the other hand believed everything in the universe to be composed of indivisible units of matter—the ancient precursor to 'atoms'—and he too had some idea of the necessity of conservation, stating that "the sum total of things was always such as it is now, and such it will ever remain."<ref>{{cite book|last=Laertius|first=Diogenes|title=Lives of Eminent Philosophers: Epicurus|url = https://www-loebclassics.com/view/diogenes_laertius-lives_eminent_philosophers_book_x_epicurus/1925/pb_LCL185.569.xml?result=1&rskey=YoU4V6}}. This passage comes from a letter quoted in full by Diogenes, and purportedly written by Epicurus himself in which he lays out the tenets of his philosophy.</ref>

In 1605, [[Simon Stevinus]] was able to solve a number of problems in statics based on the principle that [[perpetual motion]] was impossible.

In 1639, [[Galileo Galilei|Galileo]] published his analysis of several situations—including the celebrated "interrupted pendulum"—which can be described (in modern language) as conservatively converting potential energy to kinetic energy and back again. Essentially, he pointed out that the height a moving body rises is equal to the height from which it falls, and used this observation to infer the idea of inertia. The remarkable aspect of this observation is that the height to which a moving body ascends on a frictionless surface does not depend on the shape of the surface.

In 1669, [[Christiaan Huygens]] published his laws of collision. Among the quantities he listed as being invariant before and after the collision of bodies were both the sum of their [[linear momentum|linear momenta]] as well as the sum of their kinetic energies. However, the difference between elastic and inelastic collision was not understood at the time. This led to the dispute among later researchers as to which of these conserved quantities was the more fundamental. In his ''[[Horologium Oscillatorium]]'', he gave a much clearer statement regarding the height of ascent of a moving body, and connected this idea with the impossibility of a perpetual motion. Huygens' study of the dynamics of pendulum motion was based on a single principle: that the center of gravity of a heavy object cannot lift itself.

[[File:Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gottfried Leibniz]]]]
The fact that kinetic energy is scalar, unlike linear momentum which is a vector, and hence easier to work with did not escape the attention of [[Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz]]. It was Leibniz during 1676–1689 who first attempted a mathematical formulation of the kind of energy which is connected with ''motion'' (kinetic energy). Using Huygens' work on collision, Leibniz noticed that in many mechanical systems (of several [[mass]]es, ''m<sub>i</sub>'' each with [[velocity]] ''v<sub>i</sub>''),
:<math>\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2</math>

was conserved so long as the masses did not interact. He called this quantity the ''[[vis viva]]'' or ''living force'' of the system. The principle represents an accurate statement of the approximate conservation of [[kinetic energy]] in situations where there is no friction. Many [[physicist]]s at that time, such as Newton,  held that the [[conservation of momentum]], which holds even in systems with friction, as defined by the [[momentum]]:

:<math>\,\!\sum_{i} m_i v_i</math>

was the conserved ''vis viva''. It was later shown that both quantities are conserved simultaneously, given the proper conditions such as an [[elastic collision]].

In 1687, [[Isaac Newton]] published his ''[[Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica|Principia]]'', which was organized around the concept of force and momentum. However, the researchers were quick to recognize that the principles set out in the book, while fine for point masses, were not sufficient to tackle the motions of rigid and fluid bodies. Some other principles were also required.

[[File:Daniel Bernoulli 001.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[Daniel Bernoulli]]]]

The law of conservation of vis viva was championed by the father and son duo, [[Johann Bernoulli|Johann]] and [[Daniel Bernoulli]]. The former enunciated the principle of [[virtual work]] as used in statics in its full generality in 1715, while the latter based his ''[[Hydrodynamica]]'', published in 1738, on this single conservation principle. Daniel's study of loss of vis viva of flowing water led him to formulate the [[Bernoulli's principle]], which relates the loss to be proportional to the change in hydrodynamic pressure. Daniel also formulated the notion of work and efficiency for hydraulic machines; and he gave a kinetic theory of gases, and linked the kinetic energy of gas molecules with the temperature of the gas.

This focus on the vis viva by the continental physicists eventually led to the discovery of stationarity principles governing mechanics, such as the [[D'Alembert's principle]], [[Lagrangian mechanics|Lagrangian]], and [[Hamiltonian mechanics|Hamiltonian]] formulations of mechanics.
 
[[File:Emilie Chatelet portrait by Latour.jpg|thumb|right|150px|[[Emilie du Chatelet]]]]

[[Émilie du Châtelet]] (1706–1749) proposed and tested the hypothesis of the conservation of total energy, as distinct from momentum. Inspired by the theories of Gottfried Leibniz, she repeated and publicized an experiment originally devised by [[Willem 's Gravesande]] in 1722 in which balls were dropped from different heights into a sheet of soft clay. Each ball's kinetic energy—as indicated by the quantity of material displaced—was shown to be proportional to the square of the velocity. The deformation of the clay was found to be directly proportional to the height from which the balls were dropped, equal to the initial potential energy. Earlier workers, including Newton and Voltaire, had all believed that "energy" (so far as they understood the concept at all) was not distinct from momentum and therefore proportional to velocity. According to this understanding, the deformation of the clay should have been proportional to the square root of the height from which the balls were dropped. In classical physics the correct formula is <math>E_k = \frac12 mv^2</math>, where <math>E_k</math> is the kinetic energy of an object, <math>m</math> its mass and <math>v</math> its speed. On this basis, du Châtelet proposed that energy must always have the same dimensions in any form, which is necessary to be able to relate it in different forms (kinetic, potential, heat…).<ref>Hagengruber, Ruth, editor (2011) ''Émilie du Chatelet between Leibniz and Newton''. Springer. {{ISBN|978-94-007-2074-9}}.</ref><ref>{{cite book|last1=Arianrhod|first1=Robyn|title=Seduced by logic : Émilie du Châtelet, Mary Somerville, and the Newtonian revolution|date=2012|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=New York|isbn=978-0-19-993161-3|edition=US|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&aid=9444991}}</ref>

[[Engineer]]s such as [[John Smeaton]], [[Peter Ewart]], [[:de: Carl Holtzmann|Carl Holtzmann]], [[Gustave-Adolphe Hirn]] and [[Marc Seguin]] recognized that conservation of momentum alone was not adequate for practical calculation and made use of Leibniz's principle. The principle was also championed by some [[chemist]]s such as [[William Hyde Wollaston]]. Academics such as [[John Playfair]] were quick to point out that kinetic energy is clearly not conserved. This is obvious to a modern analysis based on the [[second law of thermodynamics]], but in the 18th and 19th centuries, the fate of the lost energy was still unknown.

Gradually it came to be suspected that the heat inevitably generated by motion under friction was another form of ''vis viva''. In 1783, [[Antoine Lavoisier]] and [[Pierre-Simon Laplace]] reviewed the two competing theories of ''vis viva'' and [[caloric theory]].<ref>Lavoisier, A.L. & Laplace, P.S. (1780) "Memoir on Heat", ''Académie Royale des Sciences'' pp.&nbsp;4–355</ref> [[Benjamin Thompson|Count Rumford]]'s 1798 observations of heat generation during the [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring]] of [[cannon]]s added more weight to the view that mechanical motion could be converted into heat and (as important) that the conversion was quantitative and could be predicted (allowing for a universal conversion constant between kinetic energy and heat). ''Vis viva'' then started to be known as ''energy'', after the term was first used in that sense by [[Thomas Young (scientist)|Thomas Young]] in 1807.

[[File:Gaspard-Gustave de Coriolis.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]]]]

The recalibration of ''vis viva'' to

:<math>\frac {1} {2}\sum_{i} m_i v_i^2</math>

which can be understood as converting kinetic energy to [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]], was largely the result of [[Gaspard-Gustave Coriolis]] and [[Jean-Victor Poncelet]] over the period 1819–1839. The former called the quantity ''quantité de travail'' (quantity of work) and the latter, ''travail mécanique'' (mechanical work), and both championed its use in engineering calculation.

In a paper ''Über die Natur der Wärme''(German "On the Nature of Heat/Warmth"), published in the ''[[Zeitschrift für Physik]]'' in 1837, [[Karl Friedrich Mohr]] gave one of the earliest general statements of the doctrine of the conservation of energy: "besides the 54 known chemical elements there is in the physical world one agent only, and this is called ''Kraft'' [energy or work]. It may appear, according to circumstances, as motion, chemical affinity, cohesion, electricity, light and magnetism; and from any one of these forms it can be transformed into any of the others."

===Mechanical equivalent of heat===
A key stage in the development of the modern conservation principle was the demonstration of the ''[[mechanical equivalent of heat]]''. The [[caloric theory]] maintained that heat could neither be created nor destroyed, whereas conservation of energy entails the contrary principle that heat and mechanical work are interchangeable.

In the middle of the eighteenth century, [[Mikhail Lomonosov]], a Russian scientist, postulated his corpusculo-kinetic theory of heat, which rejected the idea of a caloric. Through the results of empirical studies, Lomonosov came to the conclusion that heat was not transferred through the particles of the caloric fluid.

In 1798, Count Rumford ([[Benjamin Thompson]]) performed measurements of the frictional heat generated in boring cannons, and developed the idea that heat is a form of kinetic energy; his measurements refuted caloric theory, but were imprecise enough to leave room for doubt.

[[File:SS-joule.jpg|thumb|left|130px|[[James Prescott Joule]]]]

The mechanical equivalence principle was first stated in its modern form by the German surgeon [[Julius Robert von Mayer]] in 1842.<ref>von Mayer, J.R. (1842) "Remarks on the forces of inorganic nature" in ''Annalen der Chemie und Pharmacie'', '''43''', 233</ref> Mayer reached his conclusion on a voyage to the [[Dutch East Indies]], where he found that his patients' blood was a deeper red because they were consuming less [[oxygen]], and therefore less energy, to maintain their body temperature in the hotter climate.  He discovered that [[heat]] and [[mechanical work]] were both forms of energy and in 1845, after improving his knowledge of physics, he published a monograph that stated a quantitative relationship between them.<ref>Mayer, J.R. (1845). ''Die organische Bewegung in ihrem Zusammenhange mit dem Stoffwechsel. Ein Beitrag zur Naturkunde'', Dechsler, Heilbronn.</ref>

[[File:Joule's Apparatus (Harper's Scan).png|thumb|right|[[James Prescott Joule|Joule]]'s apparatus for measuring the mechanical equivalent of heat. A descending weight attached to a string causes a paddle immersed in water to rotate.]]

Meanwhile, in 1843, [[James Prescott Joule]] independently discovered the mechanical equivalent in a series of experiments. In the most famous, now called the "Joule apparatus", a descending weight attached to a string caused a paddle immersed in water to rotate.  He showed that the gravitational [[potential energy]] lost by the weight in descending was equal to the [[internal energy]] gained by the water through [[friction]] with the paddle.

Over the period 1840–1843, similar work was carried out by engineer [[Ludwig A. Colding]], although it was little known outside his native Denmark.

Both Joule's and Mayer's work suffered from resistance and neglect but it was Joule's that eventually drew the wider recognition.

In 1844, [[William Robert Grove]] postulated a relationship between mechanics, heat, [[light]], [[electricity]] and [[magnetism]] by treating them all as manifestations of a single "force" (''energy'' in modern terms). In 1846, Grove published his theories in his book ''The Correlation of Physical Forces''.<ref>{{cite book | author=Grove, W. R. | title=The Correlation of Physical Forces | url=https://archive.org/details/correlationphys06grovgoog | location=London | publisher=Longmans, Green | year=1874 | edition=6th }}</ref> In 1847, drawing on the earlier work of Joule, [[Nicolas Léonard Sadi Carnot|Sadi Carnot]] and [[Émile Clapeyron]], [[Hermann von Helmholtz]] arrived at conclusions similar to Grove's and published his theories in his book ''Über die Erhaltung der Kraft'' (''On the Conservation of Force'', 1847).<ref>{{cite web|title= On the Conservation of Force|url=http://www.bartleby.com/30/125.html|publisher=Bartleby|access-date= 6 April 2014}}</ref> The general modern acceptance of the principle stems from this publication.

In 1850, [[William Rankine]] first used the phrase ''the law of the conservation of energy'' for the principle.<ref>William John Macquorn Rankine (1853) "On the General Law of the Transformation of Energy," ''Proceedings of the Philosophical Society of Glasgow'', vol. 3, no. 5, pages 276-280; reprinted in: (1) ''Philosophical Magazine'', series 4, vol. 5, no. 30, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3Ov22-gFMnEC&pg=PA106&lpg=PA106#v=onepage&q&f=false pages 106-117] (February 1853); and (2) W. J. Millar, ed., ''Miscellaneous Scientific Papers: by W. J. Macquorn Rankine'', ... (London, England: Charles Griffin and Co., 1881), part II, [https://archive.org/stream/miscellaneoussci00rank#page/203/mode/1up pages 203-208]: "The law of the ''Conservation of Energy'' is already known—viz. that the sum of all the energies of the universe, actual and potential, is unchangeable."</ref>

In 1877, [[Peter Guthrie Tait]] claimed that the principle originated with Sir Isaac Newton, based on a creative reading of propositions 40 and 41 of the ''[[Philosophiae Naturalis Principia Mathematica]]''. This is now regarded as an example of [[Whig history]].<ref>{{cite book

===Mass–energy equivalence===
{{Refimprove section|date=November 2015}}
{{main|Mass–energy equivalence}}

Matter is composed of atoms and what makes up atoms. Matter has [[rest mass|''intrinsic'' or ''rest'' mass]]. In the limited range of recognized experience of the nineteenth century it was found that such rest mass is conserved. Einstein's 1905 theory of [[special relativity]] showed that rest mass corresponds to an equivalent amount of ''rest energy''. This means that ''rest mass'' can be converted to or from equivalent amounts of (non-material) forms of energy, for example kinetic energy, potential energy, and electromagnetic radiant energy. When this happens, as recognized in twentieth century experience, rest mass is not conserved, unlike the [[mass in special relativity|''total'' mass]] or ''total'' energy. All forms of energy contribute to the total mass and total energy.

For example, an [[electron]] and a [[positron]] each have rest mass.  They can perish together, converting their combined rest energy into [[photon]]s having electromagnetic radiant energy, but no rest mass.  If this occurs within an isolated system that does not release the photons or their energy into the external surroundings, then neither the total ''mass'' nor the total ''energy'' of the system will change.  The produced electromagnetic radiant energy contributes just as much to the inertia (and to any weight) of the system as did the rest mass of the electron and positron before their demise. Likewise, non-material forms of energy can perish into matter, which has rest mass.

Thus, conservation of energy (''total'', including material or ''rest'' energy), and [[conservation of mass]] (''total'', not just ''rest''), each still holds as an (equivalent) law.  In the 18th century these had appeared as two seemingly-distinct laws.

===Conservation of energy in beta decay===

==First law of thermodynamics==
{{main|First law of thermodynamics}}

For a [[Closed system#In thermodynamics|closed thermodynamic system]], the first law of thermodynamics may be stated as:

:<math>\delta Q = \mathrm{d}U + \delta W</math>, or equivalently, <math>\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q - \delta W,</math>

where <math>\delta Q</math> is the quantity of [[energy]] added to the system by a [[heat]]ing process, <math>\delta W</math> is the quantity of energy lost by the system due to [[Work (thermodynamics)|work]] done by the system on its surroundings and <math>\mathrm{d}U</math> is the change in the [[internal energy]] of the system.

The δ's before the heat and work terms are used to indicate that they describe an increment of energy which is to be interpreted somewhat differently than the <math>\mathrm{d}U</math> increment of internal energy (see [[Inexact differential]]). Work and heat refer to kinds of process which add or subtract energy to or from a system, while the internal energy <math>U</math> is a property of a particular state of the system when it is in unchanging thermodynamic equilibrium. Thus the term "heat energy" for <math>\delta Q</math> means "that amount of energy added as the result of heating" rather than referring to a particular form of energy. Likewise, the term "work energy" for <math>\delta W</math> means "that amount of energy lost as the result of work". Thus one can state the amount of internal energy possessed by a thermodynamic system that one knows is presently in a given state, but one cannot tell, just from knowledge of the given present state, how much energy has in the past flowed into or out of the system as a result of its being heated or cooled, nor as the result of work being performed on or by the system.

[[Entropy (classical thermodynamics)|Entropy]] is a function of the state of a system which tells of limitations of the possibility of conversion of heat into work.

For a simple compressible system, the work performed by the system may be written:

:<math>\delta W = P\,\mathrm{d}V,</math>

where <math>P</math> is the [[pressure]] and <math>dV</math> is a small change in the [[volume]] of the system, each of which are system variables. In the fictive case in which the process is idealized and infinitely slow, so as to be called ''quasi-static'', and regarded as reversible, the heat being transferred from a source with temperature infinitesimally above the system temperature, then the heat energy may be written

:<math>\delta Q = T\,\mathrm{d}S,</math>

where <math>T</math> is the [[temperature]] and <math>\mathrm{d}S</math> is a small change in the entropy of the system. Temperature and entropy are variables of state of a system.

If an open system (in which mass may be exchanged with the environment) has several walls such that the mass transfer is through rigid walls separate from the heat and work transfers, then the first law may be written:<ref>[[Max Born|Born, M.]] (1949). ''Natural Philosophy of Cause and Chance'', Oxford University Press, London, [https://archive.org/stream/naturalphilosoph032159mbp#page/n157/mode/2up pp. 146–147].</ref>

:<math>\mathrm{d}U = \delta Q - \delta W + u'\,dM,\,</math>

where <math>dM</math> is the added mass and <math>u'</math> is the internal energy per unit mass of the added mass, measured in the surroundings before the process.

==Noether's theorem==
{{main|Noether's theorem}}
[[File:Noether.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Emmy Noether]] (1882-1935) was an influential [[mathematician]] known for her groundbreaking contributions to [[abstract algebra]] and [[theoretical physics]].]]
The conservation of energy is a common feature in many physical theories. From a mathematical point of view it is understood as a consequence of [[Noether's theorem]], developed by [[Emmy Noether]] in 1915 and first published in 1918. The theorem states every continuous symmetry of a physical theory has an associated conserved quantity; if the theory's symmetry is time invariance then the conserved quantity is called "energy". The energy conservation law is a consequence of the shift [[Symmetry in physics|symmetry]] of time; energy conservation is implied by the empirical fact that the [[Physical law|laws of physics]] do not change with time itself. Philosophically this can be stated as "nothing depends on time per se". In other words, if the physical system is invariant under the [[continuous symmetry]] of [[time translation]] then its energy (which is [[canonical conjugate]] quantity to time) is conserved.  Conversely, systems which are not invariant under shifts in time (an example, systems with time dependent potential energy) do not exhibit conservation of energy&nbsp;– unless we consider them to exchange energy with another, external system so that the theory of the enlarged system becomes time invariant again.  Conservation of energy for finite systems is valid in such physical theories as special relativity and quantum theory (including [[Quantum electrodynamics|QED]]) in the flat [[space-time]].

==Relativity==
With the discovery of special relativity by [[Henri Poincaré]] and [[Albert Einstein]], energy was proposed to be one component of an [[four-momentum|energy-momentum 4-vector]]. Each of the four components (one of energy and three of momentum) of this vector is separately conserved across time, in any closed system, as seen from any given [[inertial reference frame]].  Also conserved is the vector length ([[Minkowski space|Minkowski norm]]), which is the [[rest mass]] for single particles, and the [[invariant mass]] for systems of particles (where momenta and energy are separately summed before the length is calculated).

The relativistic energy of a single [[mass]]ive particle contains a term related to its rest mass in addition to its kinetic energy of motion.  In the limit of zero kinetic energy (or equivalently in the [[rest frame]]) of a massive particle, or else in the [[center of momentum frame]] for objects or systems which retain kinetic energy, the [[total energy]] of particle or object (including internal kinetic energy in systems) is related to its rest mass or its invariant mass via the famous equation <math>E=mc^2</math>.

Thus, the rule of [[Mass in special relativity|''conservation of energy'' over time in special relativity]] continues to hold, so long as the [[frame of reference|reference frame]] of the observer is unchanged. This applies to the total energy of systems, although different observers disagree as to the energy value. Also conserved, and invariant to all observers, is the invariant mass, which is the minimal system mass and energy that can be seen by any observer, and which is defined by the [[energy–momentum relation]].

In general relativity, energy–momentum conservation is not well-defined except in certain special cases. Energy-momentum is typically expressed with the aid of a [[stress–energy–momentum pseudotensor]]. However, since pseudotensors are not tensors, they do not transform cleanly between reference frames. If the metric under consideration is static (that is, does not change with time) or asymptotically flat (that is, at an infinite distance away spacetime looks empty), then energy conservation holds without major pitfalls. In practice, some metrics such as the [[Friedmann–Lemaître–Robertson–Walker metric]] do not satisfy these constraints and energy conservation is not well defined.<ref>{{cite web|url=http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html|title=Is Energy Conserved in General Relativity?|authors=Michael Weiss and John Baez|access-date=5 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070605041426/http://math.ucr.edu/home/baez/physics/Relativity/GR/energy_gr.html|archive-date=5 June 2007|url-status=dead}}</ref> The theory of general relativity leaves open the question of whether there is a conservation of energy for the entire universe.

==Quantum theory==
In [[quantum mechanics]], energy of a quantum system is described by a [[self-adjoint operator|self-adjoint]] (or Hermitian) operator called the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]], which acts on the [[Hilbert space]] (or a space of [[wave functions]]) of the system. If the Hamiltonian is a time-independent operator, emergence probability of the measurement result does not change in time over the evolution of the system. Thus the expectation value of energy is also time independent. The local energy conservation in quantum field theory is ensured by the quantum [[Noether's theorem]] for energy-momentum tensor operator. Due to the lack of the (universal) time operator in quantum theory, the uncertainty relations for time and energy are not fundamental in contrast to the position-momentum uncertainty principle, and merely holds in specific cases (see [[Uncertainty principle]]). Energy at each fixed time can in principle be exactly measured without any trade-off in precision forced by the time-energy uncertainty relations. Thus the conservation of energy in time is a well defined concept even in quantum mechanics.
