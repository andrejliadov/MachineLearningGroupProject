[[Image:Feynmann Diagram Gluon Radiation.svg|thumb|287px|right|In the context of experiments involving [[quantum chromodynamics]], acoplanarity can arise from the emission of [[gluons]] from the scattered final state particles.]]

In [[particle physics]], the '''acoplanarity''' of a scattering experiment measures the degree to which the paths of the [[scattering|scattered]] particles deviate from being [[coplanar]]. Measurements of acoplanarity provide a test of [[perturbative]] [[quantum chromodynamics]], because QCD predicts that the emission of [[gluons]] can lead to acoplanar [[scattering event]]s.<ref name="REFG">

==Measures of acoplanarity==
For a two-[[Jet (particle physics)|jet]] final state, a useful measure of acoplanarity is

:<math> \varphi = \pi-( \phi_2 - \phi_1 ) </math>

where <math>\phi_i</math> are the [[azimuthal angle]]s of the final state jets with respect to the [[beam line]].<ref>

An alternative measure of acoplanarity which is [[infrared safe]] and which works for broad jets of many particles is given by

:<math> A = 4 \min{ \left( \frac{ \sum_i |p_{out}^i| }{ \sum_i |p_i| } \right)^2} </math>

where <math>p_i</math> are the momenta of the final state particles and <math>p_{out}^i</math> are the components of these momenta perpendicular to a plane chosen such that A is minimized.<ref name="REFG" />
In the case of two coplanar final state particles, the plane which minimizes A would contain the paths of both particles and the beamline, and A would equal 0.
