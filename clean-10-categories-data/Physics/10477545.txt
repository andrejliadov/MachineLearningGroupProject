{{Nihongo|The '''Japan Society of Applied Physics'''|応用物理学会|ōyō butsuri gakkai}} ('''JSAP''') is a [[Japan]]ese group of researchers in the field of [[applied physics]]. JSAP originated in 1932 from a voluntary forum of researchers belonging to the [[University of Tokyo]] and the [[Institute of Physical and Chemical Research]]. During [[World War II]], most research, even applied, was frozen. In 1946, the society was established as an official [[academic society]].

== Oyo Buturi==
'''''Oyo Buturi''''' ({{ISSN|0369-8009}}) is the membership subscription of the Japan Society of Applied Physics. It is published monthly, in [[Japanese language|Japanese]]. '''''Oyo Buturi International''''' (1998) and '''''JSAP International''''' (2000-2008) are related English counterparts to ''Oyo Buturi''.
